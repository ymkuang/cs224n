(0) Think the matter over . 
(1) If [4393]{you} think that , [4393]{you} were wrong , please apologize to all Yemenis in [4393]{your} same subject . 
(2) [4393]{You} defend [4395]{the girls of Saudi Arabia} by insulting the girls of [4399]{Yemen} . 
(3) Why ? 
(4) [4393]{You} do n't like [4400]{it} for [4395]{the girls of Saudi Arabia} , but [4393]{you} like [4400]{it} for the girls of [4399]{Yemen} ? 
(5) [4398]{I} have been a follower of the forum site for years . 
(6) [4393]{Your} topic is the first one [4398]{I} have replied to . 
(7) Because of [4393]{your} replies to the participants , [4398]{I} respected [4393]{you} and [4398]{I} still respect [4393]{you} . 
(8) But the lapse was uncalled for . 
(9) May [4401]{Allah} forgive [4393]{you} in the protection of [4401]{Allah} . 
(10) ----------------------------- 
(11) [4393]{My} outstanding brother : May [4401]{Allah} reward [4398]{you} with good and elevate [4398]{your} status . 
(12) [4398]{You} seem to be from [4399]{Yemen} ! 
(13) Anyway [4393]{I} did not mean that [4396]{that girl} was from [4399]{Yemen} , but rather that [4396]{she} was hired for cheerleading . 
(14) Because [4396]{she} tied the kaffiyeh on [4396]{her} head the way the people of [4399]{Yemen} do , [4393]{I} said what [4393]{I} did in sarcasm , not to attack the women of [4399]{Yemen} ! 
(15) ------------------------------ 
(16) It is wrong to shift our disability into a general impossibility , to be a reason for holding [4394]{others} back , and to smother [4394]{their} abilities and capabilities .

Here is the entire document; same-colored mention text indicates the gold clusters, while same-colored braces indicate your current clusters.
(0) [4473]{Paqueta} wants to finish [4478]{Saad Al - Harthi -LRB- the butcher -RRB-} in soccer and educationally . 
(1) [4467]{Night Star} 
(2) 6 x 1 = 6 
(3) [4473]{Paqueta} 
(4) Away from the club colors and loyalties .. and striving for a explanation and clarification . So far [4467]{I} have not found a convincing explanation for two incidents involving [4478]{one player , the star Saad Al - Harthi} . 
(5) The first is the matter of [4478]{his} call up to [4469]{the national team} after [4478]{he} clearly excelled at [4478]{his} club , then being put aside by [4473]{Mr. Paqueta} , outside the formation , even on the benches in the stadium . 
(6) [4478]{He} did not play even as a reserve , nor was [4478]{he} unshackled and returned to complete [4478]{his} university studies of which less than two months are left . 
(7) Acquiring [4480]{an education} remains the most important , and is the weapon that covers the professional player , especially as [4478]{Al - Harthi} had postponed [4480]{it} more than once , all during [4478]{his} participation in [4469]{the Saudi national team} ...! 
(8) So read on with [4467]{me} . 
(9) Article Six , clause three of the Professional Regulations stipulates .. that [4463]{the professional player} undertakes to continue [4463]{his} education and raise [4463]{his} cultural level 
(10) and what supports the need to look into [4478]{Al - Harthi 's} return is that [4473]{Mr. Paqueta} already has [4466]{six strikers beside Al - Harthi} and all of [4466]{them} took part in the last two games ...! 
(11) The second incident is [4475]{the report raised by al - Masibih to His Highness the President of the Union about Al - Harthi 's diligence and his readiness to represent the homeland , which raises a wider question mark about why this report concerned Al - Harthi alone} ? 
(12) Has anything happened in the past that would contradict it ? 
(13) The answer from all the fans is , of course , no ..! 
(14) Or is there [4458]{someone who ordered that this report be submitted} ..? 
(15) What are [4458]{his} motives ..? 
(16) [4467]{I} know for sure that someone will summarize [4477]{everything I referred to above} place [4477]{it} in the category of preferences . 
(17) And then [4467]{I} will not , will not care , as long as [4467]{I} want to transmit a fact that we are in great need of [4465]{players who are skilled with their brains and their legs} . 
(18) So liberate the minds of those with skilled legs so that we would enjoy a generation blessed with a civilization of progress and consciousness and awareness 
(19) Let [4470]{us all} repeat together with [4470]{our} hearts before [4470]{our} tongues " Long live [4474]{the Green} , long may [4474]{it} live " 
(20) From under the door -- 
(21) [4478]{His} last title that stuck to [4478]{him} and which [4478]{he} retained is " FIFA international expert " 
(22) So what will [4478]{he} win from [4464]{the title " the Legend of the Gulf "} apart from proving the saying " not getting tired of titles " after the overwhelming public popularity ? 
(23) What a sad media that which reduced the meeting of [4469]{our national team} with Qatar to the confrontation of Al - Shlhoub with Khalfan ..!* 
(24) The invisible reason behind [4468]{Jasim 's} decisive victory in getting [4464]{the " Legend of the Gulf " title} is [4468]{his} insistence on thanking the eight media personalities who voted for [4468]{him} !* 
(25) A question occurs to [4467]{me} . 
(26) How come a player for whom voted 55 % of an awesome number of the public does not get [4464]{the title} , while [4468]{a player with 45 %} is given [4464]{the title} on the basis of no more than eight media personalities voting for [4468]{him} ? 
(27) How ? 
(28) Since [4476]{the " one and only " media} started criticizing [4473]{the coach Paqueta} heavily .. can we innocently ask here whether [4476]{this media} has become a " middleman " striving for [4473]{Paqueta 's} dismissal and [4473]{his} return to [4479]{their} team ..? 
(29) What supports it is the delay in [4479]{their} team contracting a coach ..! 
(30) [4467]{I} found the novel -LRB- The Searcher and the Searched For -RRB- clearly in the tyrannical individualism of [4459]{Al - Shlhoub and al - Qahtani} .. and each of [4459]{them} searching for the other ..! 
(31) The emblem of the leadership did not suite [4473]{him} -LRB- neither in form mor in content -RRB- * 
(32) [4473]{Paqueta} puts [4473]{his} earpiece in [4473]{his} ear and talks on the telephone throughout the match * 
(33) This can only have two explanations . 
(34) The first is the presence of [4460]{a technical manager} in the stands , -LRB- [4460]{he} was n't there -RRB- ...! 
(35) The second is the presence of another person dictating to [4473]{him} while [4473]{he} executes ..!!. 
(36) An article copied from [4461]{the famous writer and the satellite TV voice of Nasr International , Mr. Khaled Al - Shaalan} . 
(37) This is life as seen by states .... 
(38) If [4471]{it} pleased someone for an hour , [4471]{it} made him unhappy for ages . 
(39) [4462]{A Very Ordinary Native Country} 
(40) [4467]{Night Star} , here is an advice for free : do not try and tire [4467]{yourself} with [4461]{Khaled Al - Shaalan} . 
(41) [4461]{The man} suffers from unnatural fanaticism and the problem is that there are those who support [4461]{him} . 
(42) If [4467]{you} scrutinized all [4461]{his} articles and [4461]{his} appearance on the channels and [4461]{his} transfer from one channel to another then [4467]{you} would know [4461]{this man 's} disease . 
(43) Encouragement is a nice thing . 
(44) However fanaticism , the turning of [4472]{facts} on [4472]{their} head , the schadenfreude , the mockery and the lying and innumerable , uncountable issues are present in [4461]{this sick person} ;. 
(45) [4462]{I} advised [4467]{you} and it 's [4467]{your} choice .

(0) A New Scandal : The Lebanese [4643]{Hezbollah} .. Buying [4644]{People} and Exploiting [4644]{Their} Needs . 
(1) [4642]{My} head is raised 
(2) Although [4637]{snakes} may be soft to the touch , ...... when turned over [4637]{they} have harmful fangs . 
(3) Some were astonished by the number of people who are staging [4629]{strikes} in [4636]{Lebanon} and who oppose the legitimate government of al - Siniora , and who considered this as mobilization on the part of [4643]{Hezbollah} and [4643]{its} supporters and a confirmation of the strength of [4643]{this organization} . 
(4) But the truth is completely different from that , since [4630]{the majority of strikers} are jobless and [4630]{they} have found in [4629]{these strikes} something that provides [4630]{them} with money , shelter , and food . Especially after it became clear that [4640]{these strikers} are paid money by [4643]{Hezbollah} . 
(5) Each striker is paid $ 20 a day . 
(6) Imagine [4641]{a Lebanese family on strike} . 
(7) There are [4641]{five members} , for example , so [4641]{they} will get $ 100 a day , which is a large sum for [4641]{them} that [4641]{they} would not get under any circumstances , except through this strike which [4641]{they} wish would last forever . 
(8) [4643]{Hezbollah} buys these [4627]{people} and exploits [4627]{their} needs to achieve a goal and political aims .. 
(9) It is noticed that the officials in [4643]{Hezbollah} prevent any stranger from entering the places of [4629]{the strikes} or trying to get in touch or talk with some of the strikers for fear of revealing these secrets . 
(10) [4626]{The senator} .. 
(11) Nothing new [4626]{my} brother as implied by the title of the subject , because [4643]{Hezbo Allat} trades at the expense of the Lebanese . 
(12) And the most important thing on [4643]{its} agenda is to take over the reins of power to continue the march of [4643]{its} service to [4634]{Iran} . 
(13) I am Muslim 
(14) Hahahahahahaahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahah . hahahahahahahahaha 
(15) And [4642]{you} -- how did [4642]{you} find out the secret , [4642]{you dangerous person} ? Zzzzz 
(16) And not the Mossad , sheikh . 
(17) [4626]{The senator} .. 
(18) The habit of Shiites is lying and trickery , and deceit . 
(19) [4642]{My} head is raised 
(20) [4642]{My} brother the senator . Yes , this is the truth . 
(21) [4643]{Hezbollah} is trading in the Lebanese people to serve [4643]{its} aims and the aims of those who stand behind [4643]{it} .. the interests of the [4643]{party} today are with [4634]{Iran} and [4631]{Syria} , and here [4643]{it} is serving [4638]{them} with all [4643]{its} strength ... 
(22) Accept [4642]{my} respect . 
(23) [4642]{My} head is raised 
(24) [4639]{My brother .} The facts are clear and do not need further explanations . 
(25) Last week [4642]{I} was in -LRB- Beirut -RRB- on a special visit . 
(26) [4642]{I} have relationships with many Lebanese -LRB- Sunnis and Shiites -RRB- and [4642]{I} saw what is happening on the ground of reality . 
(27) The thing is no secret , and any visitor who is eager to know [4635]{these facts} can reach [4635]{them} . 
(28) [4642]{I'll} mention to [4639]{you} a report written by an American writer who speaks about some of these issues , particularly the attempt of [4643]{Hezbollah} to obscure [4633]{the facts related to the strikes} and prevent [4633]{their} disclosure . 
(29) [4642]{My} regards to [4639]{you} . 
(30) Kissinger 
(31) How cheap by [4632]{God} ! 
(32) Intellectual of the top 
(33) [4642]{Brother , my head is raised .} 
(34) Peace to [4642]{you} and [4632]{God 's} mercy and blessings . 
(35) Yes , we have heard such talk more than once , in addition to the sums of money [4645]{they} are being provided with clothes . 
(36) [4643]{They} try to recruit [4645]{them} from the areas of the south known for extreme poverty . 
(37) All these expenses are paid by the Iranian government which is trying to control the region , whether in Iraq or [4631]{Syria} or [4636]{Lebanon} . 
(38) This is a new scandal for [4643]{this party which is exploiting the needs of the people to implement its plans} . 
(39) And peace to [4642]{you} . 
(40) The Imagination99 
(41) Confirming the words of [4642]{brother , my head is raised} . This is the source of the news . 
(42) http://www.al-majalla.com/ListNews.a...=1175&MenuID=8 
(43) [4642]{My} head is raised 
(44) Yes , how cheap , really , to buy attitudes , allegiances , values with a bunch of dollars .. 
(45) Honorable people are not bought . 
(46) Thank you .. 
(47) [4642]{My} head is raised 
(48) Intellectual of the top Have a pleasant evening . 
(49) The strange thing is that we find people who try to deny the existence of things such as these . 
(50) [4642]{I} think [4628]{he} knows the truth but because of doctrinal positions or financial gains or certain political inclinations you find [4628]{him} closing [4628]{his} mind , throwing these facts behind [4628]{his} back , and enjoying the attempt to promote and polish falsehood . 
(51) [4642]{My} regards .

Here is the entire document; same-colored mention text indicates the gold clusters, while same-colored braces indicate your current clusters.
(0) [4707]{Saddam} might be to [4698]{the Iranians} [4702]{the devil himself} , but do [4698]{they} know that [4698]{they} turned [4707]{him} , in the eyes of Arabs and Sunnis , into a virtuous saint ? 
(1) Even some Kuwaitis forgave [4707]{him} and had sympathy for [4707]{him} . 
(2) Everyone forgave [4707]{Saddam} for all [4707]{his} faults , thanks to Iranian " wisdom . " 
(3) If [4707]{the betrayed Iraqi President} knew how [4707]{he} had become in the eyes of the Islamic world after [4707]{his} execution , [4707]{he} might have weighed for [4714]{the Iranians and their agents in Iraq} tons of praise and commendation for the great favor [4714]{they} did for [4707]{him} , of which [4707]{he} had never dreamed . 
(4) It reached the level that even [4707]{his} old objectors compared [4716]{the execution of Saddam Hussein} to the assassination of our master , Omar Ibn Al Khattab , at the hands of Abi Luluah Al Majusi . 
(5) No , many even declared that [4707]{his} grave will become a holy shrine . 
(6) If [4707]{Saddam} was left for ten more years , [4707]{the man} might have died naturally without any ado . 
(7) But now that [4721]{Iran} and [4721]{its} agents have [4716]{executed} [4707]{him} in this horrible way , [4707]{he} has entered [4704]{history} by [4704]{its} widest doors , after [4707]{he} had exited history years ago . 
(8) This was thanks to the " terrible " Persian " wisdom . " 
(9) [4707]{Saddam Hussein} was one with the utmost hatred and enmity to [4700]{the Persians} . 
(10) Maybe [4707]{he} used to pray a lot against [4700]{them} , and God accepted [4707]{his} prayers and inspired [4700]{them} to conspire in [4707]{his} execution on [4699]{the Muslims ' big feast} so [4699]{Eid Al Adha} would remain connected to [4707]{his} name for decades and decades . 
(11) [4722]{I} do not know how [4718]{the Iranians} measured it , and [4722]{I} do not know why [4718]{they} sacrificed [4718]{their} tremendous popularity in the Arab street in return for satisfying a cheap and impetuous desire for revenge . 
(12) A few months ago , [4721]{Iran} was a symbol of resistance , jihad , dignity , and challenge , thanks to [4721]{its} support of Arab resistance movements like [4710]{Hezbollah} in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine , while the popularity of the Arab regimes was hitting rock bottom . 
(13) The Iranians had the right to be proud of [4706]{the glorious victory Hezbollah achieved over Israel} . 
(14) But now , [4706]{this victory} has totally evaporated in the Arab street , thanks to the stupidity of those who ordered [4716]{the execution of Saddam Hussein} and the dance over [4707]{his} body . 
(15) No , the public support for [4710]{Hezbollah} has even turned into a tremendous indignation from [4721]{Iran} and [4721]{its} allies in the Arab region . 
(16) [4722]{I} heard a lot of people connecting [4721]{the Persian enemy} and [4713]{the Zionist enemy} , while [4721]{Iran} , until months ago , was the striker in confronting the Zionist and American project in the region . 
(17) [4721]{Iran} caused great embarrassment for everyone who has supported [4721]{its} positions in the past . 
(18) [4722]{I} have heard from [4709]{a lot of people who used to defend Iran in the Arab street} , and [4709]{they} have totally turned against [4721]{it} and started to call [4721]{it} " dirty Persian " with a lot of loathing and hatred . 
(19) In recent months , [4710]{Hezbollah 's} performance in the war with [4713]{Israel} , with [4711]{Iranian President Ahmadinejad 's} announcements , speeches , challenge of the American administration , and [4711]{his} insistence on finishing the process of enriching uranium , used to resurrect pride and dignity in the souls of millions of Arabs and Muslims . 
(20) But the scene of [4707]{Saddam 's} execution turned the tables upside down on [4721]{Iran} for a time that might last for long ; let alone the horrible offense to [4710]{Hezbollah} , which lost a big portion of the street . 
(21) The proof is that [4710]{its} biggest supporters in Jordan , for example , boycotted the Manar Channel , which used to have great popularity in the Arab street . 
(22) [4715]{The Iranians} , with [4715]{their} spirit of revenge , have destroyed [4710]{the most famous Arab resistance movement} , after [4710]{it} was filling the world and occupying the minds of humans . 
(23) [4715]{They} even turned the people against [4710]{it} . 
(24) No matter how the answers vary , as Mohamed Abu Roman debates , what is obvious is that [4708]{the image of Saddam Hussein 's execution} would cost [4721]{Iran} a lot in the next stage . 
(25) [4708]{It} will make [4721]{its} credibility very weak , and [4708]{it} will also harm the image of [4721]{its} ally powers in various countries . 
(26) In addition , [4708]{it} revealed that the " Persian - national " spirit that tinctures [4721]{Iran 's} foreign policy and [4721]{its} various positions , far from the claims of enmity to [4703]{America and Israel} , are only used to serve [4721]{Iran 's} interests . 
(27) Beyond that , [4708]{the image of executing Saddam} and the repercussions [4708]{it} created cause a large embarrassment for [4721]{Iran 's} allies in the region , like Hamas , Al Jihad , Syria , and many Islamic factions , as well as [4719]{the political and public powers - in the Arab countries - which stood with Hezbollah and were calling for their governments to " change " their alliances to stand with Iran instead of the United States and Israel} . 
(28) [4719]{These powers} face a state of strong embarrassment , similar to the embarrassment of the Arab regimes friendly with [4720]{the United States} from [4720]{its} policies in the region . 
(29) [4705]{Those who wanted to quench their thirst for revenge by hanging Saddam Hussein on the first of the Adha holy days} are like [4712]{the libidinous fool who satisfied his cheap lust without knowing that he had caught a dangerous disease afterward} . 
(30) What did [4705]{they} win ?

(0) This was also the case with many of the investments in the seventies , as the greatest part of the major oil and industrial projects , the oil projects and the ports are in the southern region . 
(1) Nevertheless , the benefits would have encompassed all if it was n't for the destruction that resulted from the wars started by Saddam Hussein . 
(2) The most important thing then is integration and striving to provide the minimum level of basic needs in terms of food , accommodation , education and health for all the citizens without discrimination . 
(3) It is unreasonable for us to seek solutions to the electricity problem for each governorate , or that we have local water policies in Mesopotamia . 
(4) Seventh : discussions are to be held about the cash distribution of part of the oil revenue , 
(5) and this too will not lead to equity , nor to development and attaining public interest . 
(6) It is well known that the notion of the individual cash share from oil revenues is an alternative to [4745]{the provisions ration} , and not a supplement to [4745]{it} . 
(7) On the other hand , the effect of [4742]{this change} on inflation and on the extent the minimum level of basic needs would be provided for the poor sectors will be negative , and will have inherently harmful economic effects in the present period due to the lack of conditions for productive economic activity . 
(8) Also making [4742]{this change} could provide an additional opportunity for corruption in implementation . 
(9) [4744]{The idea} is drawn from the experience of the US State of Alaska , and [4744]{it} means moving away from public investments even in the vital sectors , as [4744]{it} is an alternative to providing electricity , water , health services and public education at affordable conditions and prices . 
(10) Finally , oil policy will be an important part of [4743]{the Iraqi national state} reconstruction and [4743]{its} rise from the present destruction . 
(11) The invitation is going out to all Iraqi patriots of various political and social hues who believe in [4753]{the current political process} and those who are outside [4753]{it} , and to the local and civil community in general , to reject the idea of [4746]{a new oil bill being issued at the present time} and for [4746]{it} to be postponed for at least a full year to start the debate about the future of the oil policy that stresses peace and the ending of the occupation as the basic requirements for a national oil policy . 
(12) As for bringing up hopes of speedy prosperity by accelerating production using [4750]{foreign companies} , that is a mirage as [4750]{the companies} will not come except under favorably secure conditions . 
(13) Also , the main economic problems in [4748]{Iraq} currently do not lie in the diminished oil revenue , but in the occupation , the security situation , the widespread corruption and theft , the dissolution of [4748]{the state} , the loss of the oil resources and the breakdown of economic activity . 
(14) How similar is present to the past . 
(15) The responsibility lies in particular on the shoulders of [4747]{the members of the current National Assembly} , notwithstanding [4747]{their} loyalties , and [4747]{they} must ask [4747]{themselves} : if the Kuwaiti National Council has been opposing for years the foreign oil investment project in Kuwait , and if [4751]{Saudi Arabia and Iran} are still holding to the nationalization of oil in [4751]{their} countries , are [4747]{they} ready to revoke Act No. 80 ? 
(16) [4752]{1st_top} 
(17) [4754]{75 % of Iraqi oil to foreign companies and 25 % to Iraqis .} 
(18) [4754]{This} is what [4749]{the Americans} want and after [4754]{that} [4749]{they} destroy what remains of [4748]{the nation} .

(0) A Skin Care Nut - Whitening . 
(1) [4788]{Beauty lover} 
(2) In terms of whitening , [4788]{I} prefer [4782]{the essence in the NeoTime gift set} . 
(3) [4782]{The bottle of essence itself} is merely a kind of moisturizing lotion , but [4782]{it} comes with a complimentary bottle of L - Ascorbic acid dry powder . 
(4) [4788]{My} way is to take a small bottle of 25 ml to pour [4782]{the essence} in , add a little L - Ascorbic acid dry powder , and shake well . 
(5) The homemade whitening lotion like this will be consumed in about a week , and the same method is used to make more . 
(6) [4788]{I} have read relevant information that [4785]{L - Ascorbic acid} oxidizes easily after [4785]{it} dissolves in the water . 
(7) [4785]{It} will lose the whitening effect once oxidized . 
(8) So , make - and - consume can ensure what [4788]{I} use are the unoxidized whitening contents , which are pretty effective . 
(9) What 's more , this is a very cheap way of use . 
(10) [4784]{NeoTime} sells for over 300 a set , including day cream , night cream and essence , of which a bottle of essence lasts for two to three months if used [4788]{my} way . 
(11) [4784]{It} is a bit more affordable than the Vitamin C whitening products that cost several hundred . 
(12) Actually , [4788]{I} have used [4786]{SKII} products . 
(13) If [4788]{I} 'm not financially constrained , [4788]{I} like to use [4786]{SKII} goddess fluid . 
(14) The skin was in a good state after use . 
(15) However , [4788]{I} heard recently that some contents in [4783]{SKII} do harm to the skin over time , and so [4788]{I} dare not use any more after a second thought . 
(16) Anyway , [4788]{my} skin now is very good without using [4783]{it} . 
(17) [4788]{I} do n't [4787]{like} wearing makeup , facing the sky everyday with bare skin . 
(18) [4787]{This} is because [4788]{my} former boyfriend said [4789]{he} [4790]{liked} [4788]{me} because [4788]{I} did n't wear makeup . 
(19) Upon hearing [4790]{this} , [4788]{I} suddenly realized it turned out no men liked their girlfriend wearing makeup . 
(20) Therefore , [4788]{I} practically do n't buy any makeups and never use blush or eyeshadow , apart from buying some lightening makeup base for use as sun screen . 
(21) [4788]{I} do n't know if everyone agrees with this . 
(22) Anyway , [4788]{I} feel very easy on the face without makeup , no need to be careful everywhere . 
(23) [4788]{I} feel uncomfortable with lip color , which makes [4788]{me} careful even if [4788]{I} 'm just drinking water .

(0) How Should We Care for Our Skin Day - to - Day ? 
(1) Amy 
(2) Who does n't want soft , white skin ? 
(3) But in real life our skin often gives us a hard time . 
(4) If it 's not darkness or redness in the face , it 's dull and pallid . 
(5) What can we do ? 
(6) Appropriately adjusting our diet could bring great improvements for our skin . 
(7) Whatever is the problem with your skin , you should prescribe " vegetables " based on your symptom . 
(8) [4813]{Red face} : [4813]{this} is caused by absorbing too much animal fat or protein . 
(9) The way to treat [4813]{this} is : when we eat [4817]{foods containing animal fat or protein} , we must supplement [4817]{it} with [4811]{vegetables that contain plenty of chlorophyll , like spinach , celery or lettuce} . 
(10) If we eat [4811]{them} raw , the effect is better . 
(11) We can also chop [4814]{vegetables} into tiny bits , wrap [4814]{them} in cloth , squeeze [4812]{the juice} and drink [4812]{it} . 
(12) [4815]{Flushed face} : the reason is poor circulation of blood , particularly a lack of blood flow to the epithelial cells . 
(13) When the weather is cold , [4809]{people 's} faces go red , particularly the tips of [4809]{their} noses . 
(14) The way to treat [4815]{this} is : 1. Frequently bathe and massage to make the blood flow freely . 
(15) Massage the red parts more . 
(16) 2. To make the body fully absorb proteins better , we should eat plenty of food containing vitamin B1 and vitamin C . 
(17) We can improve our absorption of vitamin D by exposure to sunlight . 
(18) [4818]{Oily dark face} : [4818]{this} is caused by consuming too many animal oils and vegetable oils . 
(19) The way to treat [4818]{this} is : control the amount of animal and vegetable oils we consume and eat more vegetables containing chlorophyll . 
(20) Before we eat , we should drink a glass of vegetable juice diluted with warm boiled water . 
(21) The effect will be better . 
(22) Dark face : generally speaking , [4816]{the skin of people who consume too much salt} is rough and dark . 
(23) After exposure to the sun [4816]{it} is even worse . 
(24) The hands and feet going black is caused by the salt in the body needing to be flushed out through the extremities . 
(25) If we consume too much salt , our face will gradually be covered with a layer of dark skin . 
(26) The way to treat this is : 1. control our intake of salt , drink plenty of water to flush out the salt through our urine . 
(27) 2. Bathing frequently , and soaking in the bathroom until you sweat , can also help to flush out some salt . 
(28) Freckles on the face : consuming too much salt may cause freckles to appear on the face . 
(29) And if in our diet we only [4810]{absorb} animal fats and protein , [4810]{this} will affect the normal functioning of liver and make the freckles more visible . 
(30) So those with freckles must eat plenty of fruit and vegetables . 
(31) As well as this , medicine is the great enemy of the skin . 
(32) Sedatives in particular will make the body produce too much acid . 
(33) The hormones will become unbalanced and freckles will appear on the face .

(0) What is life ? 
(1) Carefree - like 
(2) [4830]{A student in a university philosophy department} started pondering the question of what is life . 
(3) But [4830]{he} asked everyone around [4830]{him} , and none of [4830]{his} teachers was able to answer [4830]{him} . 
(4) So [4830]{he} left the university and went looking for a wise man to ask . 
(5) After 10 years , [4830]{he} finally learned of [4829]{a wise yogi deep in the mountains of India} . 
(6) [4830]{He} thereupon set out on tortuous roads , crossing over towering mountain peaks , and finally [4830]{he} found [4829]{this wise man} . 
(7) [4829]{The wise man} was seated , with [4829]{his} eyes closed . 
(8) [4830]{The student} did n't dare startle [4829]{him} , so [4830]{he} simply waited from dawn until dusk , when [4829]{the wise man} opened [4829]{his} eyes slightly . 
(9) [4830]{The student} seized [4830]{his} chance and hastened to ask : What is life ? 
(10) [4829]{The wise man 's} gaze shifted slightly ; [4829]{he} looked far off into the mountains , and [4829]{he} said profoundly : Life is a river . 
(11) [4830]{The flustered student} sprang to [4830]{his} feet : 
(12) Right ! [4830]{I} did n't take a university course on philosophical enlightenment and come all this way to hear [4829]{you} say what some little kid might say ! 
(13) What the hell is life ? 
(14) [4829]{The wise man} was greatly surprised ; [4829]{he too} jumped up and said : [4830]{You} mean ... life is n't a river ?

(0) [4881]{Guangzhou} Starts Puffing [4881]{Itself} up -LRB- reposted from Moonlight blog -RRB- 
(1) [4876]{Dift Wu} 
(2) [4876]{I} went to sina.com today and suddenly saw [4878]{a " strange " article from China Business News : " Guangzhou to Become First Mainland City with a GDP per Capita of over 10,000 US Dollars " <http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2007-01-04/051211947888.shtml>} . 
(3) [4878]{It} says that the mayor of [4881]{Guangzhou} has said that calculated by the number of people registered as residents , the GDP per capita of [4881]{Guangzhou} this year will exceed 10,000 US dollars . 
(4) The reason [4876]{I} thought [4878]{it} was strange was because according to some data that [4876]{I} already knew about <http://www.williamlong.info/archives/459.html> , [4881]{Guangzhou 's} GDP per capita should only reach the target of 10,000 US dollars in 2010 . 
(5) Even though the RMB has [4874]{increased} in value , [4874]{it} still could n't be this fast . 
(6) [4877]{This figure} must have something wrong with [4877]{it} . 
(7) And the reason for the problem was still the population figure . 
(8) [4872]{Shenzhen} and other cities all calculate GDP per capita using the permanent resident population in the calculation . 
(9) For cities with such large migrant populations , a GDP per capita calculated using the number of registered residents will be very inaccurate . 
(10) If [4881]{Guangzhou} calculates the GDP per capita using the permanent resident population , [4881]{it} 's obviously puffing [4881]{itself} up . 
(11) [4883]{People from Guangdong} are usually very low - key about wealth . 
(12) [4883]{They} 'd never compare these vanities with [4875]{Beijing} or [4880]{Shanghai} . 
(13) This way , [4883]{they} can pay a little less tax to the central authorities : keeping quiet to get rich . 
(14) In addition , everyone is very clear about the situations in [4881]{Guangzhou} and [4872]{Shenzhen} . 
(15) For many years [4881]{Guangzhou} has been just a little behind [4872]{Shenzhen} in [4881]{its} economic indices and all aspects . 
(16) [4881]{Its} GDP will soon be exceeded by [4872]{Shenzhen 's} , yet [4881]{its} population has always been higher than [4872]{Shenzhen 's} . 
(17) [4876]{I} remember [4876]{I} wrote an article " The Mystery of [4872]{Shenzhen 's} GDP per capita <http://www.williamlong.info/archives/459.html> . " 
(18) [4872]{Shenzhen 's} GDP per capita is calculated using the number of permanent residents , and it is predicted that [4873]{it} wo n't top 10,000 US dollars until about 2008 . 
(19) How could [4881]{Guangzhou 's} leaders make this kind of wild assertion ? 
(20) This kind of showing off has never been the style of people from [4879]{Guangdong} . 
(21) Various signs show that [4882]{the new team of leaders in Guangzhou} may have been transferred from another region . 
(22) [4882]{They} tend to like boasting and like playing number games to seek rewards from the central authorities . 
(23) If this really is the case , then [4881]{Guangzhou 's} prospects for economic development may be indeed not good . 
(24) Fewer empty words and more real action has always been the straightforward style of people from [4879]{Guangdong} . 
(25) Only by keeping the wealth among the people can a nation be ultimately rich . 
(26) Making the majority of people rich is the most important . 
(27) [4876]{I} hope [4882]{the new team of leaders in Guangzhou} will carefully learn from the experiences and lessons of the last few administrations and not to rival with places like [4875]{Beijing} and [4880]{Shanghai} in exaggeration . 
(28) Otherwise [4881]{Guangzhou 's} development will really be a cause for worry .

(8) What [4917]{I} say is not necessarily right , but [4917]{I} am confident that if you read [4913]{it} carefully [4913]{it} should give you a start . 
(9) Regarding everyone 's suggestions : 
(10) 1. What you pay out you will get back . 
(11) Thinking more of [4910]{other people} , seeing things from [4910]{their} shoes : before you know it , we may also [4911]{have} the habits of good people , and [4911]{this} will raise our happiness index and our likelihood of succeeding . 
(12) Most successful people are good people ! 
(13) 2. People are naturally lazy , but if we want to succeed , if we want to make a lot of money , we need to think positively and make a greater effort ! 
(14) Everybody has more or less the same IQ ; what can you use to make money ? 
(15) Hah ! Really make an effort ! 
(16) At the same time , make sure you study constantly ! 
(17) 3. Remember : things are possible only when you act ! 
(18) 4. Business opportunities can be [4912]{analyzed} ; [4912]{this} requires a good model of thinking and adequate information . 
(19) How to analyze ? 
(20) Eventually [4917]{I} will write an article explaining this in detail . 
(21) 5. Pay attention to teamwork ; one person can not achieve great things . 
(22) Always try to acquire friends who have abilities and experiences that complement yours . 
(23) If you want to establish a successful business , it 's extremely important to have several good partners . 
(24) 6. Joining up with a good company is also a shortcut to getting rich ; many new companies are now hiring , and [4914]{51.com} is currently hiring on a large scale <http://companyads.51job.com/companyads/shanghai/sh/shengdong_060627/i...> . 
(25) Everybody can also go [4915]{read} [4917]{my} blog ; [4915]{that} 's also a good opportunity . 
(26) You need to seize opportunities immediately , otherwise you may end up kicking yourself . 
(27) At the end of [4909]{2005} [4914]{51.com} will be listed among the 500 top companies on the Alexa Web site . 
(28) 7. If you have a chance , interact with those who are actually successful . 
(29) Read what those who are really successful have written ; articles like this are hard to come by . 
(30) [4917]{I} urge everyone to read the new book written by Li Kaifu , the president of Google China ; the book by Li Jian , the president of Pinsou , is also not bad . 
(31) In short : as long as you make an effort , are willing to do it ! And pay attention to your methods , everybody has a chance to succeed ! 
(32) Everybody has a chance to become a multimillionaire .

(0) Is it Really Healthy to Drink Milk on Empty Stomach ? 
(1) Healthy and happy 
(2) Protein will be wasted to drinking milk on empty stomach ? 
(3) Some say drinking milk on empty stomach will consume the protein wastefully as energy , 
(4) but actually milk contains about 45 % lactose , which is carbohydrate that will decompose first to supply energy and save protein . 
(5) In addition , milk also contains about 3 % fat , which also plays the role of supplying energy . 
(6) Therefore , drinking milk on empty stomach will not lead to protein waste . 
(7) The fact that infants under the age of one can drink milk on empty stomach and absorb nutrients proves that milk contains a variety of nutrients that can be fully used by the human body . 
(8) Even if the digestion rate will be slightly lowered , it is healthier to drink milk on empty stomach than to eat nothing the whole morning when there is no time for breakfast . 
(9) Tip : drink boiled water before milk . 
(10) It is not appropriate to take milk as the only drink in the early morning . 
(11) When you get up in the morning , it 's better to drink a big glass of boiled water -LRB- light honey water is better in case of a dry indoor environment during the heating season -RRB- before consuming milk . 
(12) As [4930]{milk} has higher osmotic pressure , [4930]{it} is far less quick and effective compared to boiled water in terms of supplying moisture . 
(13) Who can not drink milk on empty stomach ? 
(14) What needs our attention is that if there are abdominal distention or diarrhea after drinking milk , it is then indeed inappropriate to drink a lot of milk with on empty stomach . 
(15) It is better to have some starchy food before you drink milk in multiple small serves , and it is better to have yogurt . 
(16) Experts said milk can not be consumed on empty stomach 20 years ago , because [4929]{Chinese} had few chances to drink milk . 
(17) Once [4929]{they} were weaned from breast milk , [4929]{they} hardly saw any dairy products . 
(18) Long - term separation from dairy products led to " lactose intolerance " of the body . 
(19) [4927]{People} suffered abdominal distention , diarrhea or dyspepsia whenever [4927]{they} drink milk . 
(20) If [4927]{they} drink too fast , especially drinking milk on empty stomach , the symptom would exacerbate . 
(21) Now time is different , and the diet pattern has also changed . 
(22) [4928]{Many children and young people} often consume milk , yogurt , ice cream and even cheese since childhood , which bring [4928]{them} strong ability to digest milk lactose . 
(23) Even if [4928]{they} drink milk on empty stomach , [4928]{they} will not feel uncomfortable . 
(24) So , the so - called remark of " no milk on an empty stomach " should be changed , at least with a premise added , instead of being generalized .

(0) 2. If you 've selected [5048]{a given project} and are carrying [5048]{it} out , then you should definitely carry [5048]{it} through to [5047]{the end} ; avoid switching course in midstream . 
(1) Of course when [5054]{I} say [5052]{see} [5048]{it} through to [5047]{the end} , [5052]{this} does not mean to continue blindly , sticking with [5048]{it} even when you know full well [5048]{it} 's hopeless . 
(2) What [5054]{I} mean is , do n't be distracted , doing SMS today and selling things tomorrow , with a new approach every day . 
(3) You see somebody else doing [5043]{something that makes money} , and you think you want to do [5043]{that} . 
(4) Your website is simply the " art of changing your look " like in Sichuan opera . 
(5) A new face every day , completely different . 
(6) What [5054]{I} recommend is that when you set up [5044]{your business} you should give [5044]{it} careful consideration and fully investigate [5044]{its} feasibility . 
(7) Once you set out to do something , you should pursue [5053]{the goal you set for yourself} , sticking with [5053]{it} unless really forced to give up . 
(8) 3. Use your hands , eyes and brain , be observant and alert , and consider all possibilities . 
(9) Avoid acting rashly when you set up your [5041]{Internet} business . 
(10) Your mind needs to be sharp ; [5041]{the Internet} offers virtually unlimited business opportunities ; maybe [5042]{it} 's just a small opportunity , but you should seize [5042]{it} . 
(11) Then maybe you will succeed . 
(12) Otherwise if [5045]{the opportunity} was right in front of you and you did n't seize [5045]{it} . 
(13) So ... you need nimble hands . 
(14) If you come upon [5049]{something important} , by all means make a note of [5049]{it} , and so on . 
(15) Your eyes need to be sharp : you need to spot changes in the IT situation right away and quickly prepare a short - term business plan . 
(16) Like right now , [5050]{many portal sites} are seizing [5046]{the opportunity of the Olympics} to considerably increase [5050]{their} traffic . 
(17) [5054]{I} think advertising revenues in [5046]{this area alone} will be considerable . 
(18) 4. Be tough and resilient : avoid the easy route . 
(19) Setting up an [5041]{Internet} business is hard labor . 
(20) When you 're just setting up your business , it is sometimes hard to avoid feeling completely exhausted . 
(21) Sometimes you 'll just feel like throwing in the towel . 
(22) Do n't forget : if you were [5051]{working} for someone else , you would n't like [5051]{it} either , and may feel even worse ! 
(23) 5. You need to learn to look for partners . 
(24) 6. You need to know what [5041]{Internet} marketing is , and learn how to use [5040]{it} . 
(25) Are you looking for an already proven , feasible way to increase your sources of income ? 
(26) Are you looking for an opportunity to create both free time and financial freedom ? 
(27) Do you have dreams or goals that you want to reach ?

(0) [5130]{An Intellectual who was a Lifelong Leading Official until Death} -- A Few Disrespectful Words about [5130]{Director Ba} 
(1) [5125]{613305} 
(2) -LSB- Ghost turning the mill -RSB- 
(3) [5123]{The lifelong term system of leading cadres} is not good , and [5123]{it} has long been criticized by intellectuals . 
(4) The so - called idea about [5123]{the lifelong term system of leading cadres} means when the end of a term of office comes , or when a given age is reached , [5128]{they} should step down . 
(5) This point has already been put into practice , though not fully implemented in reality . 
(6) Some very bad practices have n't been abolished yet : i.e. [5120]{the lifelong remuneration system for leading cadres} . 
(7) What is known as [5120]{the lifelong remuneration system for leading cadres} means that when [5124]{a leading cadre} steps down from [5124]{his} senior position , [5124]{he} still retains [5124]{his} level of remuneration such as " division leader level . " 
(8) Even worse is that as soon as you become a leading cadre , you are then a leader for life , with no need to worry about any problems of being laid off . 
(9) If your department disappears , it does n't matter , either . 
(10) A sinecure can always be arranged for you at a salary high enough for you to maintain your integrity , like going to the CPPCC to serve as some deputy chairperson . 
(11) If you do n't break the law , you will only move upwards , you wo n't slip downwards . 
(12) [5125]{I} think we should completely abolish [5123]{the life - long term system of leading cadres} . 
(13) For example , if [5122]{a person} is mayor , when [5122]{he} steps down at the end of [5122]{his} term , [5122]{he} could no longer be given mayor level remuneration . 
(14) If [5122]{he} is not able enough and becomes a division leader , then [5122]{he} should be remunerated at the division leader level . 
(15) If [5122]{he} 's even more incompetent and has been laid off , then [5122]{he} should be like a laid - off factory worker and collect unemployment benefits . 
(16) [5122]{He} should n't go to the mayor , but to the markets . 
(17) The " iron rice bowl " was broken for workers decades ago . 
(18) There is no reason why leading cadres should still be holding onto a golden rice bowl . 
(19) [5125]{I} 've had a look at [5130]{Director Ba 's} biography and was surprised to find that [5130]{Director Ba} had been chairman of [5121]{the Writers ' Association} since 1983 right up until [5130]{he} passed away . 
(20) [5125]{I} think that [5121]{the Writers ' Association} is n't any kind of important department affecting the national economy and people 's livelihood and whether [5121]{it} was [5118]{the lifelong term system} would draw nobody 's attention . 
(21) But [5130]{Director Ba} , as an intellectual who always spoke the truth and stood up for what was right , should have known that [5118]{the lifelong term system of leaders} is not good , and should have been opposed . 
(22) Moreover , when [5130]{Director Ba} became chairman of [5121]{the Writers ' Association} , [5130]{he} was already quite elderly . 
(23) Doing it for one or two terms , [5130]{he} 'd be +really senile however you look at it . 
(24) [5130]{He} had [5130]{his} own health problems . 
(25) How could [5130]{he} have that much energy to manage the affairs of [5121]{the Writers ' Association} ? 
(26) It would have been better to get off the pot . 
(27) In fact , in [5130]{his} last days , [5130]{Director Ba} lay in the hospital , unable even to speak , completely reliant on medical intervention to keep [5130]{him} alive . 
(28) Even if [5130]{he} wanted to manage , [5130]{he} would have been unable to . 
(29) [5126]{" Harvest " magazine} was created by [5130]{Director Ba} single - handedly , and [5130]{he} was always [5126]{its} chief editor . 
(30) Even if later on it was [5119]{Director Ba Junior} who took over [5126]{the work} , [5126]{it} still carried [5130]{Director Ba 's} name . 
(31) After [5130]{Director Ba} passed away , [5126]{the magazine} still wrote that [5130]{he} was the chief editor . 
(32) In the end someone got really mad and filed a legislative complaint . 
(33) But this affair had no further development afterwards . 
(34) [5125]{I} guess the biggest reason maybe is because of [5130]{Director Ba 's} great influence , everyone settled out of court ; both sides gave a little ground , and [5119]{Director Ba Junior} no longer used [5130]{Director Ba Senior 's} name in doing advertisements for [5126]{the magazine} . 
(35) To say a little more : right now [5127]{all the intellectuals} are all heaping praise on [5130]{Director Ba 's} " Random Thoughts . " 
(36) [5127]{They} think [5131]{it} " speaks the truth , " " stands up for what 's right . " 
(37) However , what [5125]{I} like is [5130]{Director Ba 's} " Torrents " trilogy and " Cold Nights . " 
(38) [5130]{Director Ba} had written the works that made [5130]{his} name , and are [5130]{his} greatest works , before [5130]{he} was thirty . 
(39) [5125]{I} believe that what [5130]{he} said at that time was very honest . 
(40) [5130]{He} was using [5130]{his} heart and blood in [5130]{his} writing . 
(41) If you read the afterwords [5130]{he} 's written you 'll know . 
(42) [5130]{He} says [5130]{he} was often crying as [5130]{he} was writing . 
(43) [5125]{I} 've also seen that [5130]{Director Ba} was +under the deep influence of extreme leftism at that time and said many good things about the totalitarian society .

(0) Peasants blocking roads and clashing with the police : who should reflect on this ? 
(1) 613305 
(2) -LSB- Xinhua , [5198]{Jiu Taiping} -RSB- posted on [5220]{January 14 , 2007} 2:00:25 p.m. -LRB- SMS -RSB -- -LSB- Outer form -RSB- . 
(3) [5198]{Jiu Taiping} 
(4) " Rocks were moved onto [5214]{the road} , and [5216]{several dozen peasants} stood in the middle of [5214]{the road} , several hundred cars were [5210]{backed} up , and rocks were thrown at [5197]{the police} .... " 
(5) Yesterday morning after 10:00 o'clock , [5216]{villagers from some 40 households in Zhaojiacun , Xiaojie Township , Chongming County} , unhappy with [5200]{the blasting for road construction that was damaging their homes} , crowded onto [5214]{the section at the 67th kilometer of Kunqu highway now being built} , throwing stones and blocking [5214]{the road} for more than four hours , causing [5210]{a backup of hundreds of cars} . 
(6) -LRB- [5220]{January 14} , Capital City News -RRB- . 
(7) It is unreasonable to block roads and cut off traffic even if [5216]{the villagers '} homes were being damaged by [5200]{the blasting for road construction} and the economy was being hurt ; [5202]{these methods} are illegal and harm innocent bystanders ; [5202]{they} are unacceptable . 
(8) If there is a problem , [5216]{they} should seek out the concerned departments , that 's all . 
(9) However , [5216]{the villagers '} agitation has [5204]{its} own reasons . 
(10) You might say it ca n't be helped . 
(11) If [5216]{they} had been able to resolve the problem through regular channels , [5216]{they} would n't have taken such a step . 
(12) [5209]{China 's peasants} are simple and decent folk ; quite often when [5209]{they} get the short end of the stick [5209]{they} suffer in silence . 
(13) If it is not something that affects [5209]{their} livelihood , [5209]{they} are not easily moved to take action . 
(14) [5209]{They} may be simple and decent and may accept bullying , but when someone rides on [5209]{their} backs and dumps on [5209]{them} , [5209]{they} wo n't take it any more , and [5209]{they} explode . 
(15) In [5219]{my} view , the concerned parties ' disregard for the people 's interests is the basic reason that brought this on . 
(16) At the same time , in this disturbance both the [5216]{villagers} and [5197]{the police} are the victims of bureaucracy . 
(17) In the news reports , we clearly felt that [5195]{the behavior of the police} went beyond enforcement of the law ; [5197]{their} behavior infringed on human rights . 
(18) For example , when the dustup began between [5216]{the people} and [5197]{the police} , " One policeman took out [5207]{a camera} and photographed [5219]{me} ; [5219]{I} used [5219]{my} hand to block [5207]{it} , and another policeman kicked [5219]{me} in the stomach . 
(19) [5219]{I} immediately squatted down , and then they beat [5219]{me} on the face and head , [5219]{I} do n't know who it was ; [5219]{I} wiped [5219]{my} face with [5219]{my} hand , [5219]{my} hand was full of blood , they had broken open [5219]{my} mouth . " 
(20) Although the peasants ' blocking the road was against the law , the police can maintain order according to the law , 
(21) but what right do the police have to beat people and even to kick a woman in the stomach ? " 
(22) It also might be said that when a mob situation arises the police do n't want to clash with the people ; most often the police are following orders to suppress the mob and help officials restore order . 
(23) In life , [5213]{some local government officials} encounter problems of fierce resistance from the people ; instead of thinking of ways to smooth over and resolve [5206]{the problem} , [5213]{they} first think of [5196]{suppressing} [5206]{it} , and [5213]{they} 're accustomed to mobilizing the police force to forcefully carry [5196]{that} out . 
(24) In fact the harsher the suppression the more likely there will be a conflict , bringing on even greater feelings of opposition between police and people and between cadres and the masses , which does n't help resolve the problem . 
(25) Taking this case as an example , the common folk blocked [5214]{the road} because [5212]{the local government} did not resolve [5218]{the problem} . 
(26) If [5212]{it} had resolved [5218]{it} , no one would have broken the law ! 
(27) Although you can say that [5215]{blocking} [5214]{the road} was illegal , [5215]{it} 's also not a violent act ; [5203]{the police} should have continued directing traffic , and [5203]{they} might not have resorted so quickly to force . 
(28) Who brought about the clash between the police and the villagers ? 
(29) Who bears responsibility ?! 
(30) [5219]{I} believe we should first look into [5212]{the local government 's} nonfeasance in ignoring the interests of the people . 
(31) " The interests of the masses are no small matter " is not just a slogan ; it needs to be made real . 
(32) Now that there has been this disturbance , [5193]{the concerned parties} need to be vigilant ; [5193]{they} take the initiative and pay compensation for the reinforcement work , sooner rather than later . 
(33) The reason is very simple : people 's homes , which were originally unstable , can still be maintained for several more years ; this shock was n't caused by the people , and compensation should be paid . 
(34) Moreover , it is useless to quibble further about how much money should be spent on [5199]{the compensation issue} . 
(35) [5219]{I} believe there is only one standard : if [5194]{someone 's house} was destroyed , the party who destroyed [5194]{it} should restore [5194]{it} to [5194]{its} original condition , without regard to how much money the damage is worth , afraid to spend one red cent ; just restore [5194]{it} to [5201]{the original condition} . 
(36) If [5211]{the wrangling over the compensation issue} goes on forever , then [5219]{I} believe the government is still not sincere in resolving the matter of the people 's interests ; if [5211]{it} drags on and on , [5211]{it} will only intensify the conflict and make the people angry , and [5217]{history} will repeat [5217]{itself} . 
(37) Do , keep bullying [5192]{the peasants} ; [5192]{they} have it tough enough ! 
(38) [5192]{The peasants} have suffered enough ! 
(39) Give [5192]{them} the means to live !

(0) Is Blast Demolition Implementation of [5264]{the Scientific View of Development} ? 
(1) 613305 
(2) Posted by [5262]{-LSB- Qiangguo Wenhai -RSB-} at Jan 13 , 2007 13:34:56 -LSB- SMS -RSB- -LSB- Tables -RSB- . 
(3) Is Blast Demolition Implementation of [5264]{the Scientific View of Development} ? 
(4) [5262]{Wenhai .} 
(5) While [5262]{I} was watching [5266]{a TV channel} , [5262]{I} heard from [5266]{its} news , " [5259]{the tallest building beside the West Lake in Hangzhou} was blast [5261]{demolished} only 14 years after completion , because [5259]{it} ruined [5263]{the West Lake views} . " 
(6) It is said [5261]{blasting} [5259]{this " image project "} reflects " the scientific view of development " of this [5257]{Hangzhou} government . 
(7) It is unbelievable to see the report associate [5261]{the blast demolition} with [5264]{the scientific view of development} . 
(8) [5259]{The high riser} has only been used for 14 years . 
(9) What does it mean by 14 years ? 
(10) If some messy buildings are left undecorated after six years of completion , [5262]{I} think it is not inappropriate at all to describe 14 years as " brand new . " 
(11) It took such a great fortune to build a high riser like [5259]{this} , and now [5259]{it} is [5261]{blasted} at an order . 
(12) How wasteful it is in ordinary people 's eyes . 
(13) [5262]{I} will never ever believe everyone in [5257]{Hangzhou} has a place to live in without any impoverished households . 
(14) If [5268]{such a great fortune} was from government appropriation , how many tax payers were needed ? 
(15) If [5268]{it} was invested by some business person , how many machines were needed to run and how many workers were needed to be busy ? 
(16) How many people can receive education and healthcare , among other things , with such a great fortune ? 
(17) What is [5264]{the scientific view of development} ? 
(18) The core is putting people first . 
(19) [5264]{The scientific view of development} will never waste resources at will , or let people bleed and toil in vain . 
(20) [5264]{The scientific view of development} emphasizes a conservation - minded society . 
(21) [5264]{The scientific view of development} focuses on urban planning . 
(22) Maybe some people say [5259]{this tall building} has ruined [5263]{the West Lake views} , and now we have attached importance to [5264]{the scientific view of development} . 
(23) [5262]{I} would say please wait . 
(24) If [5257]{Hangzhou} has [5259]{only this one " image project , " the blast of which could restore its original state} , it can be barely regarded as " scientific development . " 
(25) The problem is whether it will work ? 
(26) [5257]{Hangzhou} belongs to people of the entire nation . 
(27) So many Chinese have been to [5257]{Hangzhou} . 
(28) The Leifeng Tower was fallen down for years , which also symbolized the emancipation of Chinese women , but later on a lot of money was invested to build [5267]{a fake tower standing beside the West Lake} . 
(29) A tour guide said : " [5265]{people} often went up to explore the relics before [5267]{it} was built , but [5265]{they} have become reluctant to go up after [5267]{it} was built . " 
(30) This affects [5260]{the West Lake} , reducing tourists at [5260]{the scenic spot} . 
(31) Should we also push over [5267]{the fake Leifeng Tower} ? 
(32) Even if [5267]{it} were pushed over , would things go back to " people going up to explore relics ? " 
(33) Thus , blasting [5259]{the high riser} can not be associated with the scientific view of development . 
(34) When [5259]{it} was first built , [5259]{it} was for image in spite of public objections . 
(35) Some netizens even said [5259]{it} was for political feats , dining out , going on inspection tours , contract awarding , and various other benefits . 
(36) If the construction was for image , then the scientific view of development should never be the excuse for [5259]{its} blast demolition . 
(37) If it is really designed to implement the scientific view of development , then simply erect a plate at [5267]{the " fake Leifeng Tower} , " which indicates " who " managed the construction of [5267]{the fake tower} . 
(38) [5258]{I} guarantee there will be tourists exploring relics . 
(39) -LRB- Original works of [5258]{Wenhai} -RRB- . 
(40) yan 
(41) Construction is science development , and blast demolition is scientific development .

(0) Does [5322]{Zhang Weiying 's} misinterpretation of revolution harbor malicious intent ? 
(1) [5330]{613305} 
(2) [5330]{-LSB- ???Lingtai Shanyin??? -RSB- .} 
(3) In an interview with [5322]{Professor Zhang Weiying} that [5330]{I} read recently , when [5330]{I} read [5322]{Professor Zhang 's} understanding of revolution , [5330]{I} felt deeply worried - deeply worried for Beijing University , deeply worried for some outstanding contemporary youth , and deeply worried for the future of [5332]{the country} . 
(4) Some people oppose the whole class struggle thing , some people deny Mao Zedong Thought , but today , with democracy making progress , some people have the nerve to talk about revolution !!! 
(5) So as not to take [5322]{his} words out of context , [5330]{I} will insofar as possible cite [5322]{Professor Zhang 's} explanation of revolution : 
(6) " In reality , ' the [5323]{way} ' - or we can call [5323]{it} ' reason ' - has quite a complex relationship with the law . 
(7) What we call ' reason ' involves looking at [5334]{what} you do to see whether [5334]{it} creates value for society . 
(8) ' Reason ' is above ' law ' : reasonable things have a natural validity ; lawmaking should be carried out according to the demands of reason ; unreasonable laws are not correct . 
(9) But in [5332]{China} , both in [5327]{the past} and now , there are many reversals of the natural order between law and reason ; thus making it hard to judge if a so - called " illegal " thing is also unreasonable . 
(10) For example , when there was [5326]{a revolution} in [5327]{the past} , it was [5329]{precisely the most idealistic people who were willing to sacrifice their lives} . 
(11) Why sacrifice [5329]{their} lives ? 
(12) Because [5326]{it} was illegal . 
(13) Or take bribery for example . 
(14) When [5335]{someone} is being blackmailed , [5335]{he} [5325]{hands} over the money , and [5325]{that} is a form of bribery . 
(15) But you ca n't say that [5335]{his} doing [5325]{that} is wrong : at least [5335]{he} deserves our empathy . " 
(16) 1. In human history , there is [5336]{a clear standard for good and evil , righteousness and iniquity , advances and reversals , glory and shame , progress and reaction , etc} . 
(17) [5336]{This standard} is : 
(18) Things that are for the majority , for the masses of people , for altruism are good , righteous , progressive , glorious , advanced . 
(19) Things that are for the minority , against the people and self - serving are bad , unrighteous , shameful , reactionary . 
(20) Revolution is clearly a thing for the majority , for the masses of people , and altruistic ; therefore revolution is good , righteous , progressive , glorious and advanced ! 
(21) 2. Law has a clear class character ; bourgeois reason makes no sense for proletarian law . 
(22) And proletarian reason makes no sense for bourgeois law ! 
(23) On major issues of principle , [5331]{lawmaking} starts with the protection of the interests of a particular class ; it is not that ' reason ' tops ' law ' : rational things have a natural validity ; so [5331]{the making of laws} should be carried out according to the requirements of reason , and irrational laws are wrong . " 
(24) This kind of so - called " reason " [5328]{ignores} [5333]{the class nature of law} , and in terms of [5322]{the great theoretician Professor Zhang 's} , [5328]{this} is a classic example of malicious intent . 
(25) What is [5322]{Professor Zhang 's} purpose in [5322]{his} misinterpretation of revolution and [5322]{his} ignoring [5333]{the class nature of law} ? 
(26) 1. [5322]{He} misinterprets revolution in order to confuse good and evil , righteousness and iniquity , advances and reversals , glory and shame , progress and reaction , and to advance some unnamable theories . 
(27) 2. [5322]{He} ignores [5333]{the class nature of law} in order to enact laws that harm the interests of the masses of workers and peasants . 
(28) Unfortunately , [5322]{Professor Zhang} may have greatly miscalculated .

Here is the entire document; same-colored mention text indicates the gold clusters, while same-colored braces indicate your current clusters.
(0) The Staple Commodities Cycle . 
(1) [5373]{The view that commodity markets have supercycles} ran into a serious challenge in [5377]{2006} . 
(2) [5375]{Oil prices} slipped by more than 25 % from [5375]{their} mid-July peak and the price of natural gas fell by more than 30 % , and prices for major metals like copper , which are sensitive to economic trends , showed signs of weakening at the end of [5377]{the year} . 
(3) The main premise of [5373]{the supercycle theory} hangs on [5369]{an extremely reliable shortage of staple commodities} ; [5369]{this shortage} was created because in the last 20 - odd years there has been a shortage of capital to invest in building new capacity for acquisition and processing . 
(4) Whereas the advance of globalization will spur sources of new demand from [5366]{China} , India and other commodity - intensive economic systems , asymmetry between supply and increasingly fierce demand causes exponents of supercycles to issue the highest commodity price forecasts in history . 
(5) In [5376]{my} view , this does not give adequate consideration to [5368]{latent demand cycles in commodity markets} . 
(6) The American real estate market shock is an example of [5368]{this} ; a sluggish market will cause demand for many materials sensitive to the homebuilding industry to drop sharply . 
(7) However , the real demand cycle may depend on [5366]{China , an economic system that accounts only for approximately 5 % of the world 's GDP , but whose increased consumption of oil and key metals accounted for fully 50 % of total global growth last year} . 
(8) Influenced by [5367]{the slowing of exports to the United States , combined with the deliberate cool - down in the overheated investment sector} , [5366]{China 's} growth will slow [5372]{next year} . 
(9) [5367]{These demand factors} will be adequate to deliver a decisive blow to [5373]{the supercycle view of the supply - driven commodity market} . 
(10) But will the lessons of [5377]{2006} be the key to success in [5372]{2007} ? 
(11) Of course things are not as simple as that . 
(12) We can undoubtedly draw some important lessons and tips from last year 's economy , but there is another important thing here ; [5376]{I} still believe that the two main engines driving global growth will slow down under the influence of the burst real estate bubble in [5374]{the United States} and the cool - down in investments in [5366]{China} . 
(13) Even though [5376]{I} do not believe the global economy is in for a hard landing , if global growth [5371]{slips} one percentage point below the average of 49 % for the last four years , [5376]{I} will not think [5371]{it} unexpected . 
(14) [5376]{My} greatest concern is that people continue to treat lightly [5370]{the continually booming risk assets markets} ; [5370]{they} include high - yield corporate bonds , institutional credit products , emerging market securities and even staple commodities , and [5370]{this} is going to be [5365]{the next bubble} . 
(15) However , like the stock and real estate markets , the economy tells us that the extreme case of [5370]{the asset markets} can always last longer than we anticipate , particularly in a time of excess current capital , but if [5365]{the risk assets bubble} lasts another year , [5365]{it} may cause more problems .

(0) It is imperative to remove the environmental subsidies to domestic and foreign consumers , internalize external environmental costs of Chinese products as soon as possible , and increase the prices of most products , including exports , in order to alleviate international trade frictions , reduce the pressure for RMB appreciation , and in particular change the prospect that the Chinese environmental resources will seriously deteriorate . 
(1) In addition , the Chinese population is huge and young , which enables [5400]{the Chinese economy} to enjoy the " population dividends . " 
(2) However , the percentage of savings is astoundingly high , and according to the hypothesis of macroeconomic balance where savings equal investments , the huge investments have become the source of high - speed economic development . 
(3) However , to depress the consumption rate to lower than 40 percent will certainly lead to overproduction , and cheap goods will in turn impact the international market . 
(4) If the US economic recession would indeed [5404]{affect} [5399]{our} export , [5404]{it} would not necessarily be a bad thing in the author 's view . 
(5) In a sense , domestic demand will not increase unless export decreases . 
(6) Over the last 20 years , the world has experienced many economic crashes , affecting countries or regions such as Russia , Arab , Latin America and East Asia . 
(7) [5405]{The US} also suffered stock market crash in 2001 . 
(8) [5399]{China} is the only one to realize economic emergence for the largest population in the history . 
(9) Whenever there is an international economic recession , [5399]{China} would actively expand domestic demand to create market for different countries . 
(10) In fact , [5399]{China} has long been a responsible big nation , playing a stabilizing role to the international society . 
(11) External pressure is an opportunity for internal restructuring . 
(12) Long - term high - speed growth in [5399]{China} has led to significant wealth growth , as well as different kinds of disequilibriums , such as : too much savings and investments and insufficient consumptions ; heavy investment in infrastructure and manufacturing , and insufficient investment in national defense , science and technology , education , health , environment and national reserves ; wider income gap , regional gap and gap between urban and rural areas ; [5400]{the economy} has become dependent on the US market to some extent due to long - term export orientation and trade surplus to [5405]{the United States} ; and environmental resource outflow by way of exporting , so on and so forth . 
(13) By now , high - speed growth of [5400]{the Chinese economy} has entered the final acceleration period that will span over a decade . 
(14) Beginning 2007 , the economic aggregate is expected to increase sharply by 150 percent , leading to the " historical disequilibrium development " predicted by Soros . 
(15) This is also why [5399]{China} is not afraid of [5398]{a global economic crisis} and capable of digesting [5398]{it} . 
(16) However , after 2020 , [5399]{China} will be facing the puzzle of population aging , which is sure to witness an economic slowdown . 
(17) As an expectation , there will be leading overreactions in financial and real estate areas by around 2015 . 
(18) [5403]{We} must complete a series of tasks in [5402]{this period} , including system restructuring , overcoming the financial crisis , improving national defense strength , safeguarding national security , realizing technological upgrade and protecting the environment . 
(19) The economic growth in future will be realized primarily through technological advancement and social harmony . 
(20) Within [5402]{these years} , the sharply grown wealth of RMB? 40 trillion shall be used effectively in areas including national defense , science and technology , environment , national soil renovation , and adjusting social relations . 
(21) It wo n't do to rely solely on the market mechanism and economic strength . 
(22) To realize , there should also be a correct strategy , relying upon the comprehensive strength of the culture , [5403]{the nation} and the society . 
(23) Various disequilibriums in the rapid growth of [5403]{China} must be adjusted . 
(24) From this perspective , [5401]{the US economic recession} imposes external pressure on the economic restructuring , which is also an opportunity . 
(25) Whether the impacts brought to [5403]{China} by [5401]{the US economic recession} can be resisted and the impacts on the world economy can be alleviated hinge on whether or not [5403]{China} can truly expand [5403]{its} domestic demand . 
(26) The next few years may see the Chinese economy cooling down , a continuous modest rise in RMB , a slowdown in the speed and volume of export growth , a possible decrease in trade surplus , and speculative capital and the real estate bubble in control , which are adjustments from disequilibriums to equilibriums in the economic relations between [5403]{China} and [5405]{the United States} and between [5403]{China} and the world , as well as in the social relations within [5403]{China} .

(5) [5433]{Luneng 's} background and [5433]{Luneng 's} " birth " are inseparable from the state - owned monopoly of [5431]{the electricity industry} . 
(6) [5431]{The electricity industry} has huge assets and occupies a market position of natural monopoly . 
(7) During [5433]{Luneng 's} rapid expansion , how much " blood " [5433]{it} actually extracted from state - owned assets seems to be [5432]{a " cloudy issue} . " 
(8) What 's the idea with scrambling to " complete " privatization before [5432]{this issue} is cleared up , handed over to the public and announced to the media ? 
(9) Fourthly , it 's said that [5436]{the two private " companies " that finally " assumed ownership " of Luneng Group , Guoyuan Union Co. and Shouda Nengyuan Energy Co.} -- according to descriptions in the media , [5436]{these two companies} can be called " low profile " and " mysterious . " 
(10) If it was an open and above - board " assumption of ownership , " then why the " mystery ? " Why the " low profile ? " 
(11) According to reports , the origins , backgrounds and sources of capital for [5436]{these two companies} are completely beyond comprehension . 
(12) Is it possible that by some kind of " buying from yourself " process [5436]{they} have embezzled state - owned assets ? 
(13) Fifthly , the departments supervising state - owned assets and the electricity industry are [5438]{SASAC and SERC , respectively} . 
(14) But with [5433]{Shandong Luneng Group} undergoing such enormous changes , [5438]{they} say [5438]{they} " do not know what 's going on . " 
(15) [5438]{They} say , " [5438]{We} have not yet received [5433]{Luneng Group 's} application materials for the transfer of stocks . " 
(16) But what 's strange is that according to reports by journalists , [5433]{Luneng Group 's} business registration has in fact already " been adjusted . " 
(17) What 's more , " since November 2006 , Shandong Provincial Administration of Industry and Commerce has not allowed requests to see or inquire about the files of [5433]{the Luneng family of companies} . " 
(18) What on earth does this mean ? 
(19) Is it the Caijing reporter " making rumors , " or are [5438]{the relevant departments} neglecting [5438]{their} supervision ? 
(20) No matter how it is , now that the media have publicly reported on it , there ought to be some answer . 
(21) So , who exactly will look into these backroom deals that have been exposed by current reports ?

(0) Untimely Democracy .

(2) Poster : [5482]{tlu -LRB- ^_^ -RRB-} , Section : ChinaNews . 
(3) Topic : Untimely Democracy . 
(4) Posting station : [5479]{BBS Unnamed space station} -LRB- Mon Jan 8 07:57:27 2007 -RRB- . 
(5) After [5485]{Taiwan} achieved democracy , hundreds of thousands of people turned out in the streets repeatedly to demonstrate . 
(6) Since [5476]{Iraq} achieved democracy , the situation has bordered on civil war . 
(7) [5480]{China 's} population is many times [5473]{theirs} , and [5480]{our} average educational level is lower than [5473]{theirs} . 
(8) If [5480]{we} blindly pursue so - called democracy that is not in keeping with the times , what happened in [5473]{Taiwan and Iraq} will certainly be many times worse here -LRB- as a multiple of the population -RRB- . 
(9) [5480]{China} could certainly [5488]{fall} into a situation of rule by gangsters or religious forces , or civil war . 
(10) When [5488]{that} happens , the chaos of the Cultural Revolution will pale by comparison , and it will be too late to cry . 
(11) Then there will be no need for America and Japan to attack [5480]{us} , [5480]{we} 'll be too busy fighting each other . 
(12) [5480]{We} wo n't need to be concerned with [5485]{Taiwan} ; even the Northeast will be independent . 
(13) Let 's say it again : it suits the interests of the West for [5480]{China} to become a disunited country with no production capacity and no fighting ability . 
(14) But so - called democracy is just a talking point ; [5478]{some people} take democracy as the ultimate form of morality , cloaking [5478]{themselves} in democracy in order to buy contraband . 
(15) Promoting democracy at least sounds better than promoting [5480]{China 's} return to a feudal empire or primitive society .

(22) [5482]{I} answer frequently asked questions only once ; excuse [5482]{me} if [5482]{I} am unable to answer each similar question individually . 
(23) This question is very easy to answer ; that is , the meaning of [5484]{these leaders '} democracy is not the same as the democracy of those who are anti-Chinese . 
(24) [5484]{The leaders '} democracy is the democratic dictatorship of the people ; [5477]{this} has basically already been achieved , or is being achieved . 
(25) Because of cognitive issues , [5489]{some people} may feel [5489]{they} have been cheated . 
(26) Do not misunderstand [5482]{me} ; [5482]{I} support democracy . 
(27) But [5482]{I} support democracy in keeping with the times . 
(28) That is , a primitive society has the democracy of a primitive society ; a slave society has the democracy of a slave society ; a society in [5486]{the early stages of socialism} has a democracy suitable for [5486]{the elementary stages of socialism} . 
(29) Changes may occur in basic concepts of mathematics and physics because of new discoveries ; does the substance of democracy really remain unchanged for thousands of years ? 
(30) In other words , in the appropriate period , and for the appropriate groups , the appropriate democracy needs to be implemented . 
(31) That is [5482]{my} view of democracy . 
(32) ??? Mentioned in the works of Wang2004 -LRB- Welcome everyone to BBS.Nlone.net -RRB- : ??? . 
(33) : " [5480]{China 's} shortcoming is that [5480]{it} lacks democracy ; [5480]{it} should thoroughly implement democracy throughout [5480]{its} territory . " 
(34) : -- June 12 , 1944 , Mao Zedong responds to Chinese and foreign reporters . 
(35) : [5480]{China} has [5474]{a fault} , and [5474]{it} is a major fault . 
(36) [5474]{This fault} , in a word , is that [5480]{it} lacks democracy . 
(37) The Chinese : people have an extraordinary need for democracy ; because only with democracy can [5481]{the War of Resistance} be strong : only then can Chinese internal and external relations : get on track , only then can we win [5481]{the War of Resistance} , only then can we build a good China , and only with democracy can we get [5480]{China} to continue : [5480]{its} unity after [5481]{the war} . 
(38) [5480]{China} lacks democracy , which all of you present are fully aware of . 
(39) Only with democracy can [5480]{China} move forward . 
(40) . 
(41) : ...... 
(42) : In order to defeat our common enemy and to establish good and peaceful internal relations , and good and peaceful : international relations , what we hope for from [5483]{the Kuomintang government and the Kuomintang Party and all its factions} is that [5483]{they} all implement democracy . 
(43) The entire : world is in this fight , and [5487]{the war} is in [5487]{its} decisive stages in Europe . 
(44) The decisive battle will come soon in the Far East , but [5480]{China} lacks a

(5) [5521]{Half of the Japanese people} are descendants of [5525]{the Han race} -LRB- proved by modern genetics -RRB- , and [5521]{they} inherited [5521]{their} culture from [5525]{us} as well . 
(6) More or less [5521]{they} can somehow talk practically and realistically . 
(7) Before the year N , [5523]{most Koreans} were the descendants of [5531]{northwestern nomads} ; [5531]{they} were pressured by [5525]{the Han} for N years , and [5523]{they} bear animosity . 
(8) If in those years [5529]{the " Great East Asian Circle of Common Glory "} is unfortunately achieved , it should be a bit more bearable than in the Qing Dynasty when [5524]{the Manchus} shaved [5525]{our} heads . 
(9) For the long - term , if [5525]{we} let the descendants of the overseas Han come to force [5529]{the Great East Asian Circle of Glory} , it wo n't be as good as if [5525]{we} make [5529]{it} happen [5525]{ourselves} . 
(10) Then [5525]{we} 'll send troops to be stationed in Korea and follow the system of [5524]{the Manchus} from [5528]{those times} , setting up a frankpledge system , with [5530]{the bride} spending [5530]{her} wedding night with the lord of the frankpledge .

(0) The First Sino - Japanese War , the Russo - Japanese War and 9/18 all ended in a short time , and there were no destructive effects on [5598]{Japan 's} economic structure . 
(1) On the other hand , each time [5598]{they} fought , [5598]{they} acquired a large amount of booty , which greatly increased [5598]{Japan 's} strength . 
(2) But [5599]{the War of Resistance} was not like that ; [5598]{the Japanese} were unable to support [5599]{the war} through fighting . 
(3) Despite [5585]{America 's} strength and wealth , [5585]{it} was even unable to bear the cost of the Vietnam War . 
(4) Four years of fierce fighting in [5593]{China} had in fact left [5598]{Japan} exhausted ; military spending was exploding , inflation at home was soaring , supplies were stretched thin , gold and foreign currency reserves were depleted , and the domestic economy was on the verge of collapse , and this enabled [5585]{America} to throttle [5598]{the Japanese} by the neck , meaning that [5585]{they} forced [5598]{the Japanese} to take a highly risky military gamble . 
(5) The outbreak of the war in [5584]{the Pacific} was a turning point . 
(6) Since [5598]{Japan} is an island , sea transport is [5598]{its} lifeline , so the decisive field of battle was [5584]{the Pacific} . 
(7) [5591]{The Chinese field of battle} had already fulfilled [5591]{its} mission . 
(8) [5593]{China} did not have the strength to chase out the Japanese army . 
(9) And [5598]{the Japanese} did not have the capability to wipe out the " Chongqing army " and the " Yan'an army . " 
(10) Both sides could only stay put and wait . 
(11) " If [5590]{allied forces} win , [5593]{China} can not lose ; 
(12) If [5590]{the allied forces} lose , [5593]{China} can not win . " 
(13) Although it upset the Americans , [5597]{the Kuomintang} blamed [5589]{the Communist Party} for not attacking ; [5589]{the Communist Party} accused [5597]{the Kuomintang} of remaining passive , but that was necessary at the time . 
(14) Although [5593]{we} were unable to [5594]{drive} [5598]{the Japanese} out , because [5594]{this} exceeded [5593]{China 's} industrial capacity and technical and economic levels at the time , " 8/15 " is still [5593]{our} Victory Day . 
(15) [5593]{Our} sacrifice well deserves this victory , because [5593]{we} made every effort . 
(16) Among the five victorious nations of the Soviet Union , [5585]{the United States} , [5593]{China} , [5596]{England} and [5582]{France} , [5593]{China} is more qualified than [5596]{England} and [5582]{France} to bask in the glory of victory . 
(17) Before WWII , in the area of world industry and modern military affairs , [5593]{China} was really unworthy of mention , not even on a par with Poland , Yugoslavia or any other mid-level European country . 
(18) [5593]{China 's} contribution to the war against Fascism in fact far surpassed [5593]{its} own abilities . 
(19) And [5600]{this contribution} was made using " blood and flesh to build [5593]{our} new Great Wall . " 
(20) For this day , [5586]{millions of Chinese soldiers} stained the battlefield with [5586]{their} blood , and tens of millions of ordinary people died , billions of yuan in assets were lost : [5583]{it} was a huge price to pay . 
(21) [5593]{We} can not forget [5593]{our} glory , nor can [5593]{we} forget [5583]{the price we paid} . 
(22) -LRB- 4 -RRB- 
(23) Several years back [5595]{Zhou Zuoren} and [5592]{Zhang Ailing} 's works thrilled a generation . 
(24) But some people complained that [5581]{they} have been treated unfairly . 
(25) [5581]{Their} works certainly appeal to the emotions and tastes of people nowadays who have gotten rich by various means , and literarily speaking [5587]{they} could sometimes be original . 
(26) But literature is a moral force , and the integrity of [5581]{these easy - living social paragons} is even lower than that of thieves ; [5581]{they} certainly have no sense of duty to [5581]{their} country , and it can even be said that [5581]{they} have no shame . 
(27) How can [5581]{they} expect to be respected by society as a whole ? 
(28) What kind of soul do [5581]{their} works have ? 
(29) If we can forgive [5595]{Zhou Zuoren} and [5592]{Zhang Ailing} , then how , at the very worst , can we face Zhao Yiman , Yang Jingyu and Chao Shangzhi , who at the same historical period crawled over ice and slept in snow , willing to die rather than yield ? 
(30) [5593]{Our} world is still not peaceful ; [5593]{our} enemies are still eyeing [5593]{us} covetously . 
(31) [5588]{Wang Jingwei , Zhou Zuoren , Zhang Ailing} and [5588]{their} ilk should be relegated to history 's wall of shame forever .

Here is the entire document; same-colored mention text indicates the gold clusters, while same-colored braces indicate your current clusters.
(0) In the past when the local tyrants and despots among [5627]{the minorities} were overthrown , [5627]{the masses of minorities} and [5630]{the Han} were equally happy . 
(1) But today [5627]{they} find that the cadres and capitalists from [5632]{those years} are now standing together , and the [5630]{Han} people of the same class from [5632]{those years} are beginning to suppress [5627]{them} . 
(2) Of course some people say that [5626]{the Communist Party} and most [5630]{Han} cadres have made many contributions to the construction of border and minority areas , and have sacrificed so much . 
(3) Right , [5627]{the minorities} should be grateful and remember the contributions of the [5630]{Han} cadres , and this proves that any two ethnic groups can live peacefully together . 
(4) However , it can also be said that [5626]{the Party} and the country have a duty to provide basic infrastructure and improve economic development , 
(5) because since you govern this land , and you collect taxes , do you really want to wipe your ass and leave ? 
(6) More importantly , [5629]{the so - called " preferential policy "} can only be given by a powerful ethnic group or force . 
(7) This should be common knowledge - the people who can give are always higher - ups . 
(8) And [5627]{the weaker ethnic groups} can only accept [5629]{it} passively . 
(9) But let 's not mention on what basis [5626]{the Communist Party} divided 55 ethnic groups into " minorities " !!?? 
(10) The essence of [5626]{our Party 's} ethnic preferential policies is to permanently institute this strong - weak relationship between [5630]{the Han race} and [5630]{its} fraternal ethnic groups -LRB- the relationship between the center and the fringe , the governing and the governed . 
(11) Let [5630]{the Han race -LRB- mainly meaning the inner bureaucracy -RRB-} act like the emperor , doling out to [5627]{the " minority "} here and there . 
(12) And [5627]{the " minorities "} can only feel deeply grateful , how will [5627]{they} dare discuss equality !! 
(13) People who are given consideration are in mainstream eyes the weak ; as time goes by , [5628]{the " minorities " who are given consideration} also get accustomed to this arrangement and believe that [5628]{they} are the weak ones and should be dominated , as if [5628]{they} were inferior !!!! 
(14) Do n't you see it , 
(15) but whenever there is some event like National Day or May First , all the ethnic groups get together in Tiananmen Square , and [5623]{people} dress as " minorities , " wear [5623]{their} costumes , [5623]{their} traditional folk dress , even if [5623]{they} have never worn [5624]{such outfits} in [5623]{their} daily lives . 
(16) While the [5630]{Han} leaders and representatives are wearing Western suits and leather shoes . 
(17) What does [5631]{this} explain ? 
(18) [5631]{It} perfectly reflects this strong - weak relationship : [5630]{the Han} are contemporary , and [5627]{the minorities} are backward , stuck in the past and abnormal !!!! 
(19) This is the price to pay for being considered !!! 
(20) What need is even there to talk of abuse !!?? 
(21) All ethnic groups have been enslaved . 
(22) What else is there ? 
(23) The result of receiving consideration is the degeneration of these ethnic groups , with no hope of progress . 
(24) Do n't we really know where [5625]{those people} got [5625]{their} sour grapes ?

(5) [5665]{Ding Yunhong , who came from mainland China and then immigrated to Windsor , Ontario , by way of the US ,} will attend the public hearing for judgment on [5665]{his} accusation of [5668]{the federal government} at 10:00 a.m. next Monday -LRB- January 8 -RRB- at [5671]{the federal appeal court in Toronto} . 
(6) During [5665]{Ding Yunhong 's} application for citizenship , [5667]{a CIC official} accused [5665]{him} of violating the law such as going to [5666]{the US} without notification , failing to report children upon landing , and attending school while collecting unemployment benefits . 
(7) [5665]{Ding Yunhong} gave explanations and responses to these accusations one by one , believing that [5667]{this government official 's} abuse of power had constituted infringement of [5665]{his} rights protected by the Canadian constitution and laws . 
(8) After filing complaints with [5664]{CIC} several times with no results , [5665]{Ding Yunhong} filed [5663]{a complaint against the Canadian government} with [5672]{the federal court in Toronto} on July 22 , [5675]{2004} . 
(9) After receiving [5663]{the complaint} , [5672]{the civil court} prosecuted the case on October 1 , [5675]{2004} . 
(10) On December 3 of [5675]{the same year} , [5665]{Ding Yunhong} became a Canadian citizen . 
(11) However , [5665]{he} believed [5665]{he} had suffered enough humiliation and damage during the application process and therefore further filed [5665]{his} complaint with [5671]{the federal appeal court} to demand justice . 
(12) [5665]{He} said that getting involved in the lawsuit with the [5668]{government} and court had subjected [5665]{him} and [5665]{his} family to tremendous pains and that [5665]{he} had suffered long - term depression because of that , but [5665]{he} could not do nothing for any injustice and discrimination imposed on [5665]{him} and will continue to fight .

(0) Low - Cost Flying ; [5717]{the Chunqiu Airline Experience} 
(1) [5721]{vox} 
(2) [5721]{Poster : vox -LRB- voice -RRB-} , Section : BackHome . 
(3) Topic : Low - Cost Flying ; [5717]{the Chunqiu Airline Experience} . 
(4) Posting station : BBS Unnamed space station -LRB- Sat Jan 20 09:51:22 2007 -RRB- . 
(5) Low - Cost Flying ; [5717]{the Chunqiu Airline Experience} . 
(6) [5721]{vox} 
(7) [5728]{The country 's} first civilian - operated airline is headquartered in [5725]{Shanghai} . 
(8) The first impression is that the English name is too vulgar , china-sss.com , would anybody be interested in putting [5733]{this company 's} announcement on Jay Leno ? 
(9) [5721]{I} heard people saying [5734]{the ticket prices} are cheap . 
(10) Then [5721]{I} went online and looked ; there are A and B classes , but no first - class cabin . 
(11) Every day a certain number of specially priced seats can be reserved only online . 
(12) [5734]{The ticket prices} are certainly the cheapest . 
(13) [5733]{Chunqiu} is encouraging online booking with a 30 - yuan discount , which saves on costs . 
(14) But paying online in [5728]{China} is extremely complicated ; that 's another story . 
(15) [5729]{The baggage limit} is 15 kg , but [5721]{I} see lots of people whose baggage are definitely over [5729]{that} . 
(16) [5721]{I} did n't see complete data online for [5733]{their} flight safety record . 
(17) [5722]{The A320 model} is one commonly used only on minor routes . 
(18) The planes are not as old as the same models in the U. S. 
(19) Signs say the life vests are under [5720]{the seats} , but in fact under [5720]{the seats} it 's absolutely empty . 
(20) Someone next to [5721]{me} asked [5732]{the flight attendant} , and [5732]{she} was unable to answer . 
(21) A male flight attendant then said there were no life vests . 
(22) After [5721]{I} got back to the States [5721]{I} hitched a ride on [5731]{a plane of the same model} , and the signs said the seat padding could be [5724]{used} as a flotation device . 
(23) [5724]{That} must be correct . 
(24) On board , aside from a small bottle of water , no beverages were offered , but [5733]{they} were selling [5723]{boxed meals} , [5723]{all of them} with the same packaging , for ???28 a box . 
(25) There were also soy - sauce eggs , preserved eggs , peanuts and other snacks . 
(26) [5721]{I} do not feel that this is a good approach on brief short - haul passenger flights . 
(27) First , [5733]{they} have to remember the passenger 's order and seat number , collect the money -LRB- and check for counterfeits -RRB- . Then heat [5718]{the meal} , deliver [5718]{the meal} ... there 's more than just one type of meal , and the preparation is n't always simple . 
(28) It 's all helter - skelter enough . 
(29) Many people were still eating just before [5731]{the plane} landed . 
(30) Plus [5733]{they} also enthusiastically peddle gifts to earn extra income . Such as model airplanes , dolls ... 
(31) [5721]{I} saw one person pay 200 for a model airplane . 
(32) In order to reduce the number of empty seats , [5731]{the plane} even has [5727]{passengers going to different destinations} ; after [5731]{the plane} landed at [5725]{Shanghai} , [5727]{those people} stayed on [5731]{the plane} and waited for the cabin to be cleaned and tidied , and only after new passengers were boarded did [5727]{they} continue on [5727]{their} way . 
(33) After [5719]{we} landed at [5725]{Shanghai} , an airport bus [5726]{transferred} [5719]{us} ; [5733]{they} did n't use the bridge . 
(34) [5733]{They} said [5726]{this} was another cost - saving measure . 
(35) In short , [5731]{the plane} was on time , the baggage was delivered quickly , and the service was OK . 
(36) This kind of train - like business approach is rather unusual .

(1) [5778]{iseesea} 
(2) [5778]{Poster : iseesea -LRB- iseesoisee -RRB-} , Section : Overseas . 
(3) Topic : Cultural Revolution ? Makes [5778]{Me} Think of the Past 
(4) Posting station : BBS Unnamed space station -LRB- Wed Jan 24 00:42:30 2007 -RRB- . 
(5) This anti-Cui " movement " made [5778]{me} think of the past . 
(6) When [5778]{I} was in junior high school , [5776]{a man who lived nearby} died ; [5778]{I} do n't know why , but rumors started flying , everybody said [5776]{his} wife murdered [5776]{him} . 
(7) [5781]{The two of them} had been together for many years , and at the time [5781]{their} two children were older than [5778]{I} was . 
(8) [5776]{This man} was very honest , and [5768]{the woman} had always been very sociable , and even though the medical examiner had already examined [5777]{the body} , [5778]{I} do n't know where all this talk came from , but [5776]{the man 's} family insisted on reopening the casket and re-examining [5777]{it} . 
(9) [5771]{This affair} stirred up quite a hubbub in our little town . 
(10) [5778]{My} mom , too , just kept discussing [5771]{it} on and on . 
(11) To [5778]{my} mind [5771]{it} was totally uninteresting , [5778]{I} just felt these middle - aged women were extremely suspicious , and [5778]{I} could n't see what all the fuss was over [5768]{that woman} . 
(12) Then one day [5778]{my} mom was at [5772]{the table} , the saliva spraying , and [5778]{I} just could n't stand it anymore . 
(13) [5780]{Mom} , do n't keep repeating what other people say , OK ? 
(14) [5780]{You} say somebody killed somebody ; what proof do [5780]{you} have ? 
(15) [5778]{My} mom rapped [5780]{her} chopsticks on [5772]{the table} : [5778]{You} 're just a kid , what do [5778]{you} know ? 
(16) There are no waves without wind ; if [5770]{this} were nothing , people would n't be talking about [5770]{it} so much . 
(17) [5778]{I} did n't dare answer [5780]{the old lady} back , but [5778]{I} thought to [5778]{myself} : Just wait and see , wait until [5768]{this woman} has been proven innocent , then [5780]{you} wo n't have anything to say . 
(18) [5768]{This woman} was really quite a character ; not only was [5768]{she} on good terms with some of the bigwigs at [5782]{the plant} , [5768]{she} was also quite familiar with [5779]{the head of the city 's public security bureau , who had been transferred over temporarily from the plant} . 
(19) The matter of whether to open the casket dragged on and on , and finally , because the pressure from public opinion was so great , they re-examined the body , and [5773]{the result} was poisoning . 
(20) When [5773]{that} came out , everybody was in an uproar . 
(21) To calm the public , finally there was a trial , and [5768]{the woman} was found guilty of murdering [5768]{her} husband . 
(22) Everybody felt that , in such a case , [5768]{she} would certainly get the death penalty , but [5768]{she} was given a stay of execution . 
(23) After several years , [5779]{the head of the city 's public security bureau} became head of the provincial public security department , and then some people said that again this [5768]{woman} might show up in the provincial capital . 
(24) [5778]{I} think that if the world did not have [5774]{" wretched men " who waste endless time tangled up in this sort of thing like Cui 's , or " big - mouthed women " like my mother} , people like [5774]{them} , who [5778]{I} feel have always been good at certain things , then people would be able to get away with murder or other crimes .

(4) Originating site : [5804]{BBS} Unknown Space -LRB- Sun Jan 21 21:10:52 2007 -RRB- . 
(5) In principle , [5806]{I} am already in [5806]{my} thirties and turning forty anyhow , but [5806]{I} am still disgusted upon seeing [5807]{it} . 
(6) [5806]{I} am not sure if [5805]{Cui} fucked a minor . 
(7) If [5805]{he} was [5806]{my} friend , [5806]{I} will most probably avoid contacting [5805]{him} until [5805]{he} cleans it off . 
(8) People have bottom lines after all . 
(9) Some things are absolutely unacceptable , like murder , like fucking a minor . 
(10) When [5806]{I} was back in China this year , [5806]{I} tutored little girls at two relatives homes , feeling 14 - 17 is a very dangerous age group for girls . 
(11) You can see clearly how [5813]{she} considers problems , and [5813]{she} easily opens up [5813]{her} thoughts and emotions to you , . 
(12) where the worst is [5813]{she} thinks [5813]{she} understands everything . 
(13) Only rascals would harm [5811]{these people} . 
(14) You will understand what [5806]{I} mean if you have a daughter . 
(15) There are something that [5806]{I} will never understand , for example having sexual impulse for [5811]{girls between 14 and 17} . 
(16) It only makes [5806]{me} feel funny and concerned to know [5811]{their} various naive and innocent thoughts , as well as [5811]{their} virtually groundless admiration for and trust in you . 
(17) Who will harm [5811]{these people} ? 
(18) When [5806]{I} just met [5806]{my} wife , [5809]{she} was a volunteer at some women 's organizations . 
(19) [5806]{I} also went for help and met a lot of single mothers discarded , or even tortured by men . 
(20) Many ideas have changed . 
(21) [5808]{People} can be very bad , while simultaneously [5808]{they} are decent lawyers , doctors , professors and engineers . 
(22) Many people/matters make you hard to believe . 
(23) [5810]{Some people} are just like the colleagues and teachers around you , but [5810]{they} have done very contemptible things , which could be said even worse than beasts . 
(24) In the past , [5806]{I} always thought [5812]{many laws and regulations} were ridiculous in the United States , but [5806]{I} feel [5812]{they} are quite reasonable after experiencing these . 
(25) In order to protect the weak , it is necessary for the powerful to sacrifice some interests or conveniences . 
(26) After all , the so - called " sacrifices " are no big deal , while the disasters endured by the weak are much heavier . 
(27) Please guard your moral bottom line , even if you do not have a teenage daughter .

(0) Instead of Fighting among [5850]{Ourselves} , Think of Whether You Have Actual Power to Seek Benefits for Chinese People

(2) [5854]{Poster : zhuxi -LRB- chairperson -RRB-} , Forum : Overseas 
(3) Title : Instead of Fighting among [5850]{Ourselves} , Think of Whether You have Actual Power to Seek Benefits for Chinese People 
(4) [5854]{Poster 's} Site : mitbbs.com [5847]{BBS} -LRB- Wed Jan 3 00:39:42 2007 -RRB- 
(5) At present , [5853]{Chinese in the US} are already an underrepresented group among the underrepresented groups . 
(6) [5853]{Their} actual power is far less than Indians ' . 
(7) [5856]{Chinese people 's} influence on the US politics and society is almost zero . 
(8) It can be said that [5856]{they} are typically subject to [5849]{excessive humiliation} -LRB- [5854]{I} did n't misuse [5849]{the word} , well - known US media can openly humiliate Chinese without having to worry about consequences -RRB- . 
(9) Under such circumstances , [5851]{these self - proclaimed , so - called elites , graduates of China 's " famous " universities -LRB- Note , I mean China 's , there are n't many of those braggarts attending the famous US universities in which their departments are the top ten -RRB-} , instead of thinking about how to get united , are getting [5851]{themselves} disabled first . 
(10) Assuming that you have achieved the best you have wanted , with only students from your respectful universities left in [5858]{the US} , what would be the result ? 
(11) Could [5848]{things} exist with [5848]{their} foundation gone ? 
(12) [5854]{I} guess your days would be also numbered . 
(13) Indians are waiting to reap profits from your conflict . 
(14) If you think [5854]{I} am exaggerating things to scare people , then shut up . 
(15) No more wasting your own and other people 's time out of boredom . 
(16) Be a student , or a researcher , what ultimately counts is the vision . 
(17) Nobel prizes are not given to highest scorers on the college entrance exams , but to [5852]{those who can clearly point the direction in their chosen field} . 
(18) Playing little clever tricks on minor issues , but blinded to major issues by trifles are not considered to be elites . 
(19) Elites at least should " not be muddle - headed in major affairs . " 
(20) [5857]{Those who want to use abusive words} , continue to do so . 
(21) Even if [5854]{I} would be drowned in [5857]{your} saliva , [5854]{I} still would like to speak for the Chinese compatriots who want to get united . 
(22) To put it impolitely , [5857]{you people} and [5857]{your} name will be both gone , while rivers will flow on forever . 
(23) In the end , whoever seeks benefits for the Chinese people will be [5855]{respected} by all . 
(24) [5855]{This} is not something that [5857]{you} can get through arguments .

(2) [5903]{Poster : huff -LRB- Brigade chief -RRB-} , section : Overseas . 
(3) Topic : [5903]{I} am grateful to [5916]{the University of Science and Technology} 
(4) [5902]{Posting station : BBS Unnamed space station} -LRB- Tue Jan 2 12:18:26 2007 -RRB- , Forward . 
(5) [5910]{Everybody} has [5910]{their} own reasons for choosing a university ; because the cost of living in Hefei is cheaper , and [5903]{I} did n't want [5903]{my} parents to spend all [5911]{their} money , [5903]{I} [5901]{chose} [5916]{the University of Science and Technology of China} . 
(6) Years later , looking back on [5901]{this choice} , [5903]{I} certainly do not have any regrets . 
(7) Perhaps if [5903]{I} 'd chosen two schools in Beijing , [5903]{I} would n't be here today talking about how [5916]{USTC} is . 
(8) But [5916]{USTC} at the time was weak ; considering location , expenses , promotion and connections , [5916]{USTC 's} greatest wealth was [5916]{its} students . 
(9) If [5900]{we} had n't come forward and done something for [5916]{USTC} , [5916]{it} would have been finished . 
(10) This is also the main reason [5916]{USTC} students banded together . 
(11) Because [5903]{I} chose science and technology as [5903]{my} career , [5903]{I} am grateful to [5916]{USTC} for teaching [5903]{me} many things , and [5903]{I} am grateful to [5907]{the reputation established by the previous president of the university , who enabled those who came after to benefit from it} . 
(12) Precisely because [5903]{I} feel this gratitude , [5903]{I} want to repay [5916]{USTC} . 
(13) [5903]{I} regularly do [5903]{my} job properly and do not let [5916]{USTC} lose face . 
(14) [5903]{I} want to save money out of [5903]{my} meager fellowship to help [5905]{a poor university student} with [5905]{his} living expenses for four years . 
(15) [5903]{I} want to go back to [5914]{China} to make [5903]{my} contributions ; [5903]{I} also want to provide the needed help to future students of [5903]{my} university . 
(16) When [5903]{I} see [5913]{people} attacking [5916]{USTC} , [5903]{I} sometimes want to take the time to [5906]{defend} [5916]{it} , even though [5906]{that} may not help much . 
(17) [5913]{Those USTC haters} have [5913]{their} own reasons ; [5903]{I} do n't intend to change [5913]{their} thinking . 
(18) But with [5914]{China 's} universities being so backward , what contributions have [5904]{these naysayers} really made to [5904]{their} alma maters and [5904]{their} country ? 
(19) Like [5912]{gaddy , for example , who first badmouths USTC students for not wanting to contribute money , says he himself has some money , and then wants to spend money filing a lawsuit because of a dispute over personal feelings on the bbs} . 
(20) [5912]{This hater} really has some problems of [5912]{his} own . 
(21) After graduating , [5903]{I} will go back ; no matter where [5903]{I} work , [5903]{I} 'm still a [5916]{USTC} student , and [5903]{I} have no regrets about [5916]{USTC} and no regrets about [5903]{my} country .

(28) [5909]{I} am also a [5916]{USTC} student , but everybody has studied abroad ; there 's no need to divide up into groups and quarrel all the time . 
(29) Chinese people love to beat up on Chinese people . 
(30) [5909]{I} love [5916]{USTC} , [5909]{I} love [5914]{China} . 
(31) Without [5914]{the fatherland} , there 'd be no [5916]{USTC} -LRB- or your university -RRB- ; without [5916]{USTC} -LRB- or your university -RRB- , there 'd be no [5909]{me} now .

(5) Select and buy according to the following : . 
(6) Internal support characteristics . 
(7) Multidirectional movement during aerobic exercise requires extremely solid shoes . 
(8) Each manufacturer provides different internal support characteristics . 
(9) Some manufacturers use a molded midsole , so that the foot can land just right inside the shoe ; fibers going all around the shoes can also provide support . 
(10) In order to increase shoe flexibility , some manufacturers add a fiberboard padding only at the heel . 
(11) External support . 
(12) A firm , resistant heel support can greatly reduce heel displacement . 
(13) [5949]{The wider part of the outsole} is called the heel fixed strip . 
(14) [5949]{It} is made of plastic and spreads all the way around the foot , attached to the heel support . 
(15) Many shoes now use a fixed frame ; the fixed frame is a polymer part that is used as support and is distributed longitudinally around the outside of the shoe . 
(16) Other stability characteristics include a plastic support strip -LRB- generally connected to the eyelets -RRB- , Velcro hook , middle uppers can also provide side support characteristics . 
(17) Shock absorption . 
(18) [5955]{Repeated impacts during aerobic exercise} produces unique pressures that generally correspond to five times your body weight . 
(19) Therefore good shock - absorbing performance is essential . 
(20) The midsole helps to disperse [5955]{these impacts} . 
(21) A good midsole is made from extruded EVA or polyurethane . 
(22) The various manufacturers have come up with various technologies to further increase the midsole 's shock absorption . 
(23) If you are someone with insufficient downward tilting , or engage in intense exercise , you may require greater shock absorption than people with excess downward tilting . 
(24) Replaceable insoles . 
(25) [5950]{The insole} also has a certain shock - absorbing function , but at the same time [5950]{it} is the easiest to ruin . 
(26) As for replacing the insole when [5951]{the shoe} is halfway through [5951]{its} life , there is a basic principle involved ; after 150 hours of aerobic exercise , [5961]{the insole} may lose [5961]{its} bounce , and this is when [5961]{it} should be replaced . 
(27) -LRB- This varies according to the person and the type of training . -RRB- 
(28) Elasticity . 
(29) A shoe 's elasticity is determined by how you feel when your feet move . 
(30) Shoes with just a fiberboard pad at the heel have better flexibility than athletic shoes using a complete fiberboard design . 
(31) Athletic shoes with low uppers can also improve flexibility . 
(32) Fit . 
(33) [5947]{Your feet} may swell when [5947]{they} are under pressure and engaging in aerobic exercise . 
(34) The heat produced by intense exercise may cause the feet to swell by half a size . 
(35) At the same time , when you buy [5952]{shoes} [5952]{they} should not be too tight ; there should be a space as wide as a thumbnail between the tip of [5954]{the shoe} and your longest toe to ensure that your toes can move freely , and [5954]{it} should fit properly at the heel . 
(36) In addition , you should regularly measure the length of your feet , because increasing age and injuries can change the size of your feet .

(60) [5958]{I} reckon this refers to domestically produced shoes . 
(61) But after you add an insole , the impact on the knee joints is much less . 
(62) The kind of heel insoles on the Wal - Mart pharmacy shelves are OK .

(6) No success so far . 
(7) Finally somebody introduced [5988]{me} to [5989]{one} ; we made a schedule for the weekend to go to [5986]{a classmate 's} house for dinner , and also meet [5989]{the new date} . 
(8) [5989]{She} looked not bad ; [5989]{she} was a former co-worker of [5986]{our classmate 's} wife ; [5989]{her} appearance was proper , and eating and all was no problem ; [5988]{I} 'm just an ordinary older WSN .

(12) [5989]{mm} was very happy to come to dinner , but [5988]{I} am rather shy -LRB- so [5988]{my} cousin says -RRB- . 
(13) So [5988]{I} did n't talk to [5989]{her} , and after dinner we all sang K , then [5988]{my} classmate 's wife suggested [5988]{I} see [5989]{mm} home . 
(14) [5989]{She} refused , and after that [5988]{I} never got together with [5989]{mm} again ... 
(15) That was [5988]{my} first time ... for a blind date ...

(0) Be Your Own Psychiatrist . 
(1) Li Xu . 
(2) In today 's society , fierce competition , cultural conflicts and material temptation disturb our minds incessantly , which often make us feel worried , anxious , upset and furious . 
(3) [6057]{People} also try to adjust [6057]{themselves} in [6060]{material ways} , but [6060]{those} often fail to work : exercises can not lessen the concerns at heart ; physical and mental fatigue persist not long after traveling ; the soft water bed can not bring comfortable sleeps ; and the luxurious room can not dispel the disputes of spouses . 
(4) That 's why someone proposes that modern people learn a new survival skill -- learn to be your own psychiatrist , helping yourself to dissolve all sorts of metal stresses at work and in life . 
(5) Be your own psychiatrist , simply put , is to improve your ability adjust yourself psychologically . 
(6) To elaborate , it means there should be a special role in your mind who possesses " the third eye " mentally to observe your emotional changes sensibly and find out the reasons for mental disturbances . 
(7) It is just like the " guardian angel " whom everyone has in Western legends , who gives you wisdom at critical moments and help you deal with the intricate reality properly , so that you will not lose direction . 
(8) There was [6055]{a famous British psychologist named Ellis} in the last century , who encouraged people to learn a special , reasonable and healthy way of thinking by reading professional books , organizing group discussions and doing specific training in thinking , in order to deal with emotional problems caused by stresses . 
(9) [6055]{He} should be the first one to advocate " learn to be your own psychiatrist . " 
(10) [6055]{He} encourages people to learn a new way of thinking like " learning a foreign language . " 
(11) The most important aspect in being your own psychiatrist is to learn to substitute the healthy way of thinking for the unhealthy way of thinking . 
(12) For example , ask two people to observe the same glass , if [6059]{one} notices a tiny speckle and the [6061]{other} notices the mild color , then [6059]{the former 's} thinking pattern might be pessimistic , while [6061]{the latter} might be more sensitive to the positive aspect of things , which is a healthy and optimistic way of thinking . 
(13) Thus , learn to observe the positive aspect of things has become an important training . 
(14) To be your own psychiatrist , you should also learn to observe stress - related signs . 
(15) For example , if you have a stomachache , your normal response is to see a gastroenterologist . 
(16) Through observation by " the third eye , " you may see that the reason can be your new demanding boss . 
(17) To be your own psychiatrist , you also need to learn appropriate knowledge . 
(18) There was [6058]{a student at the Tsinghua University , who were troubled by " depression " for a while} . 
(19) When [6056]{it} was bad , [6058]{he} wanted to jump out and commit suicide at the sight of a window . 
(20) With some psychological knowledge , [6058]{he} knew [6056]{it} was a symptom of mental disorder , so [6058]{he} immediately sought help from professionals and received treatment soon . 
(21) Now in [6054]{many European and American countries} , some intellectuals including young college students like to read psychological books . 
(22) Psychological books can always be seen in the best seller lists in [6054]{these countries} . 
(23) Most readers do not aim to become counsellors , but to learn psychological knowledge to help personal growth . 
(24) Such healthy awareness is worth learning . 
(25) This july , lemonade , music , and the summer breeze .

(0) When stamps have risen in value to a certain degree , even if you ask [6069]{someone} to , [6069]{he} wo n't use [6071]{stamps that are worth more than their face value} as postage . 
(1) The more stamps appreciate , the fewer stamps will surely be used as postage . 
(2) This reasoning is obvious . 
(3) Second is using the scientific approach to development to decide the quantities of stamps distributed . 
(4) When the quantity of stamps distributed is large or too great , the practice of stamp collecting is damaged . 
(5) The number of stamp collectors is then greatly reduced . 
(6) This has been proved by past events . 
(7) The quantities distributed of new stamps must be appropriate for the actual situation . 
(8) Too many is no good ; too few is no good either . 
(9) This is the fourth way to get rid of [6070]{them} . 
(10) The destiny of [6070]{discount stamps} is : [6070]{they} came gradually , [6070]{they} 'll go gradually , and despite everything we 'll redouble our speed .

(0) Many discoveries are made by chance . 
(1) [6099]{Michael Zhou} 
(2) [6099]{I} remember [6099]{my} first year studying at [6101]{Qinghua} , [6099]{I} went to [6099]{my} first elective course called " Inspirations in the History of Physics . " 
(3) There were only ten or so of us who had chosen [6102]{it} that semester . 
(4) [6094]{The teacher} was very erudite , [6094]{his} lectures were very lively ; [6094]{he} summarized all of the recent and contemporary history of physics , and each time [6099]{I} was enthralled . 
(5) In all [6099]{my} five years at [6101]{the university} , [6099]{I} never had another course that interesting . 
(6) If [6099]{I} were to summarize [6102]{this course} , it would be : [6096]{the greatest discoveries in physics} all had [6096]{their} own necessity and theoretical basis -LRB- for example , the development of mathematics -RRB- . 
(7) This theory can also be applied to cooking . 
(8) [6097]{One day} [6099]{I} wanted to make green beans and bean curd sheets -LRB- dried tofu in the Northeast -RRB- . 
(9) Here [6098]{the dried tofu sold in the stores} is all compressed , very tough . 
(10) So [6099]{I} normally steep [6098]{it} in hot water , then take [6098]{it} out and stir - fry [6098]{it} . 
(11) Because [6097]{that day} [6099]{I} needed to go out in the middle of it and buy some things , [6099]{I} set [6095]{the timer} and told [6099]{my} wife to turn off [6093]{the heat} when it was done .

(0) [6204]{Frozen Time} : [6206]{Leap - Year Day} 
(1) [6204]{Frozen Time} 
(2) On [6210]{the 23rd of the twelfth month of the lunar year} , we celebrate [6206]{leap - year day} , and [6211]{the Spring Festival} is getting closer and closer . 
(3) [6214]{The two of us} are busy doing [6214]{our} makeup and [6214]{our} hair . 
(4) Custom has it that you should not get your hair cut in the first month of [6213]{the lunar year} , 
(5) And before [6211]{the Spring Festival} there are [6209]{more people than usual getting their makeup and hair done} . 
(6) Abing laughingly allowed [6204]{me} to go on the second day of the second month when [6216]{the two dragons} raise [6216]{their} heads to get [6204]{my} hair cut . 
(7) In the evening [6204]{I} had nothing to do , so [6204]{I} decided to look for someone to gamble with . 
(8) [6204]{I} called [6208]{a friend} , but [6208]{he} had just moved into [6212]{a new home} . 
(9) Today for [6206]{leap - year day} [6208]{his} father - and mother - in - law were gathered with [6208]{his} family at [6208]{his} house to make jiaozi , so it appears we ca n't get together for gambling today ! 
(10) [6221]{Tutu and I} went home and ate a great meal , [6204]{I} lit some candles , and [6221]{the two of us} celebrated [6206]{the holiday} . 
(11) The custom of paying respects to [6202]{the Kitchen God} . 
(12) According to traditional custom , every year on [6210]{the 23rd of the last month of the lunar year} , [6202]{the Kitchen God} is supposed to ascend to [6205]{Heaven} and report to [6219]{the Jade Emperor} on this home 's good things and bad for [6219]{the Jade Emperor} to reward or punish . 
(13) So when [6197]{they} pray to [6202]{the Kitchen God} , [6197]{people} place [6215]{sweets , fresh water , black beans , and hay} on a table in front of [6202]{the Kitchen God 's} image ; the last three of [6215]{these} are for the horse that [6202]{the Kitchen God} rides to [6205]{Heaven} . 
(14) On the evening of [6210]{the 23rd of the twelfth lunar month} , you 're supposed to place a tray of [6201]{candied melon} on the table . 
(15) This is because you hope [6202]{the Kitchen God} will eat [6202]{his} fill of sweets and then " tell good things in [6205]{Heaven} and bring good fortune when [6202]{he} returns . " 
(16) After you put [6201]{the candied melon} on , you take down [6220]{the image of the Kitchen God that was hung above the stove the previous year} and burn [6220]{it} at the side of [6222]{the stove} ; then you wait until the 30th when you put up the spring couplets and hang a new Kitchen God in the original place , and you hang up a couplet with the first line saying " Ascend to [6205]{Heaven} and tell good things " and the second line reading " Return and bring good fortune , " and the horizontal saying is " Ruler of This Home . " 
(17) Then you also put an incense burner there and every time you celebrate a festival you light incense and pray for happiness . 
(18) Folk custom says that men do not worship the moon and women do not sacrifice to [6202]{the Kitchen God} , so it is only the men who make these sacrifices to [6202]{the Kitchen God} . 
(19) Legend . 
(20) A long time ago , there was [6218]{a well - to - do family named Zhang} ; in middle age , [6218]{they} had [6217]{a son} . 
(21) [6224]{The husband and wife} gave [6224]{their} son the name Zhang Guisheng , and later people called [6217]{him} Zhang Sheng . 
(22) When [6217]{Zhang Sheng} grew up , [6217]{he} liked to eat , was lazy , and [6217]{he} often went gambling , so [6224]{the old husband and wife} decided to marry [6217]{him} off and let [6224]{their} daughter - in - law manage [6217]{him} . 
(23) [6224]{They} sent someone to propose [6207]{this marriage} to [6198]{a comely girl in the village named Guo Dingxiang} . 
(24) [6198]{Dingxiang} soon came to live with [6218]{them} , but after [6207]{the marriage} [6217]{Zhang Sheng 's} behavior worsened . 
(25) [6198]{Dingxiang} persuaded and cajoled , but in the end [6198]{she} was beaten and kicked by [6217]{Zhang Sheng} . 
(26) Not long after , [6224]{the two aggrieved elders} passed on . 
(27) One day , [6198]{Dingxiang} rolled out [6203]{a bowlful of long , fine noodles} and waited for [6217]{Zhang Sheng} to return to eat , and [6198]{she} took the opportunity to again urge [6217]{him} to change [6217]{his} ways , but [6217]{Zhang Sheng} pushed [6203]{the bowl} away and left . 
(28) After this , [6217]{Zhang Sheng} threw out [6198]{Dingxiang} , sold off the family possessions and land , and spent [6217]{his} days living a life of dissipation . 
(29) After being thrown out , [6198]{Dingxiang} went to South Mountain . 
(30) There [6198]{she} spent [6198]{her} days clearing land and planting crops , and in the evening [6198]{she} wove ; after years of arduous toil , [6198]{she} became a wealthy woman with a hundred mu of fine land . 
(31) When [6217]{Zhang Sheng} had sold off all [6217]{his} possessions , [6217]{he} began to beg for a living . 
(32) Only then did [6217]{he} repent , and [6217]{he} thought of how worthy [6198]{Dingxiang} was . 
(33) One day , [6198]{Dingxiang} saw [6199]{a beggar} enter [6198]{her} courtyard , and [6198]{she} realized [6199]{it} was [6217]{Zhang Sheng} . 
(34) [6198]{Good - hearted Dingxiang} took [6217]{Zhang Sheng} into the kitchen and with [6198]{her} own hands gave [6217]{him} [6200]{a bowl} , setting [6200]{it} on the table . 
(35) [6217]{Zhang Sheng} saw [6200]{this bowl of long , thin noodles} and knew [6217]{he} had come begging to [6198]{Dingxiang 's} home ; feeling ashamed , [6217]{he} smashed [6217]{his} head into the stove and killed [6217]{himself} . 
(36) Later the Jade Emperor made [6217]{him} [6202]{the Kitchen God} and put [6217]{him} above the stove so [6217]{he} could watch other people eat but not eat [6217]{himself} , and told [6217]{him} that was [6217]{his} punishment .

(0) [6279]{Guo Kai 's} Economics Notes : [6288]{Six Cachets} ! 
(1) [6279]{Guo Kai 's} Economics Notes 
(2) [6294]{I} took the subway to meet someone at the railway station today and found [6280]{a red header document posted everywhere inside the subway station} . 
(3) A closer look told [6294]{me} [6280]{it} was the notice about [6285]{public transportation price adjustment in Beijing} . 
(4) [6294]{I} did n't care about the details because the news had been heard for a while . 
(5) What attracted [6294]{me} was [6288]{the six red cachets below the notice , respectively Development and Reform Commission , Education Commission , Social Security Bureau , Financial Bureau , Traffic Commission and Transportation Administrative Bureau} . 
(6) [6294]{I} know roughly the reason why the cachets of [6286]{the former four organizations} are required . 
(7) [6281]{Development and Reform Commission} is the organization in charge of prices . 
(8) [6287]{Education Commission} and [6292]{Social Security Bureau} correspond to the population on whom this policy may have relatively greater impact on . 
(9) [6278]{Financial Bureau} is the organization providing the fund . 
(10) [6294]{I} do n't know what kind of organizations [6283]{Traffic Commission} and [6291]{Transportation Administrative Bureau} are . 
(11) [6294]{I} even do n't know why [6277]{these two organizations} are not a single organization - Judging from the name , it seems that [6291]{Transportation Administrative Bureau} could be a division of [6283]{Traffic Commission} definitely . 
(12) However , now that the subway does have something to do with traffic and transportation , there is nothing strange with the appearance of the cachets of [6277]{these two departments} . 
(13) Then , what surprised [6294]{me} ? 
(14) When [6294]{I} saw [6288]{these six cachets} , [6294]{my} first reaction is that it is absolutely hopeless to rely on [6284]{the government itself} to control institutional thickening . 
(15) There must be a reason for a bloated government . 
(16) Look , [6294]{I} found out the reason for [6288]{these six cachets} with the slightest effort . 
(17) However , [6294]{I} am totally an outlier . 
(18) It is much easier for [6293]{these governmental departments} to find an excuse for [6293]{their} existence , is n't it ? 
(19) And [6293]{their} excuses are always affirmative , and always for the interests of the common people . 
(20) The existence of governmental departments is different from the existence of private institutions . 
(21) [6282]{Private institutions} spend [6282]{their} own money , and too much expansion will make [6282]{them} suffer loss . 
(22) What [6289]{governmental departments} spend is taxpayers ' money . 
(23) Regardless how much is spent , as long as the amount is not ridiculously large , [6289]{they} will never face the risk of loss and closing down 
(24) [6289]{They themselves} can find excuses for thickening without worrying about the problem of money . 
(25) What kind of excuses governmental institutions have will prevent thickening ? 
(26) [6294]{I} can hardly figure it out . 
(27) Of course , [6294]{I} do n't have any objections against [6285]{this downward adjustment of public transportation prices} , but [6288]{those six cachets} are really too striking .

Here is the entire document; same-colored mention text indicates the gold clusters, while same-colored braces indicate your current clusters.
(0) Recall the story of mandatory newspaper recycling in [6356]{the District} . 
(1) As a political city , [6356]{they} created so much waste product [6356]{they} flooded the market . 
(2) If you want to look down the road , think about what is going to happen after we spend a few billion to meet the [6359]{Chesapeake Bay} waste water restrictions . 
(3) Where are we going to put [6362]{all the sludge that results} ? 
(4) Once we stop putting [6362]{it} in [6359]{the Bay} , we are going to have to put [6362]{it} on the land . 
(5) Then we will have regulations to prevent sludge runoff in order that we do n't pay for the same sludge creation multiple times . 
(6) Eventually we will outlaw gravity so that sludge is prohibited from running downhill . 
(7) Coming soon to a farm near you : two month 's worth of stench . 
(8) As an engineer and a flinty New Englander , and a farmer , [6358]{I} spend a lot of time fixing [6355]{old junk} . 
(9) [6358]{I} ca n't stand throwing something away . 
(10) Maybe some of it comes from growing up on an island where there was no place to throw [6355]{it} . 
(11) [6358]{My} father used to say that [6367]{garbage} was like scotch tape . 
(12) -LRB- Shaking [6361]{his} thumb with an imaginary loop of tape on [6350]{it} . -RRB- 
(13) `` You ca n't throw [6367]{it} away , 
(14) you can only stick [6367]{it} someplace else . '' 
(15) When [6358]{I} 'm [6370]{repairing} [6351]{something that was designed so it ca n't be fixed} , it makes [6358]{me} crazy . 
(16) [6358]{I} want to go find some enginner and marketing guy an knock heads together . 
(17) Here are a few examples . 
(18) A rototiller with gears made out of free machining brass . 
(19) Guaranteed to fail . 
(20) [6368]{A windshiel wiper motor installed in a totally inaccessible place under the dash .} 
(21) [6368]{It} was installed by compressing [6354]{four little rubber studs} into holes in the sheet metal , and sealed with a ten inch oblong flat gasket . 
(22) When [6354]{the rubber studs} rotted away , [6368]{the motor} fell on the floor , followed by a torrent of rain that shorted out everything under [6365]{the dash} . 
(23) A 1/4 inch diameter spring loaded shift lever detent that you had to break the tractor in half to replace . 
(24) Every piece of household plumbing and wiring [6358]{I} ever had to fish through a hollow wall . 
(25) Anything that can only be repaired upside down . 
(26) [6357]{A twelve bolt circle on a transmission housing with six hex head bolts and six star pattern bolts .} 
(27) Try and figure [6357]{that} out in the dark under the car . 
(28) The ignitor for [6360]{the gas range} that costs 25 % of what [6360]{the range} cost . 
(29) What 's worse is , that because [6358]{I} 'm good at [6370]{this} , people think [6358]{I} like [6370]{it} . 
(30) Wrong . 
(31) [6358]{I} hate things 
(32) and [6358]{I} love flesh . 
(33) [6358]{I} 'm convinced that things are inhabited with Gremlins . 
(34) It 's a vicious circle . 
(35) The more stuff you have the more stuff you need to maintain it , like the [6369]{Virginia} Highways . 
(36) It starts with a screwdriver , 
(37) and next thing you know it 's a shopfull of air compressors , saws , welders , a forklift , an earthmover , a dump truck to haul the earthmover ..... 
(38) [6358]{My} wife takes great glee in making fun of all of this . 
(39) Then [6358]{I} pointed out [6353]{all he special purpose tools in her kithchen} , 
(40) and [6353]{that} is just for one job . 
(41) [6352]{She} carefuly forgets all that when [6352]{she} needs something and it turns out that [6358]{I} have just the right framitz to manufacture a repair piece for [6352]{her} thing - a - bob . 
(42) [6358]{I} 'm convinced that we could solve our balance of payments deficits if we just passed must be repairable laws . 
(43) Every engineer should be required to be a mechanic for ten years . 
(44) For [6366]{many of us} [6366]{our} life has come down to buy it at Wal - mart and take it to the dump . 
(45) Even if you buy it at the BMW or John Deere dealer it is no different . 
(46) So , if PEC wants to make a supporter out of [6358]{me} , the way to do it is to start a campaign that ensures things do n't have to be thrown away , not one to recycle them at a loss . 
(47) [6358]{I} work for [6364]{E-Tech Recycling Inc -LRB- http://www.etechrecycling.com -RRB- , an electronics recycling company located in Virginia} . 
(48) [6364]{We} recycle all types of electronics items such as computers , monitors , TVs etc. 
(49) When [6358]{I} speak with [6363]{people} about the importance of recycling electronic items , [6363]{they} are very ignorant . 
(50) [6358]{I} think more than anything , we need to educate people about the importance of recycling .

(0) Like [6422]{you} , [6422]{Jim} , [6428]{I} see the bright silver lining . 
(1) [6428]{I} seem to be getting more questions whenever [6428]{I} pull up in [6428]{my} hybrid . 
(2) One data point . 
(3) 2:53 Why are gas prices often significantly different for the same brand between Prince William and Fairfax Counties and even at different locations within the same county ? 
(4) Zone pricing is trying to do much more than reflect different tax rates . 
(5) Take a look at the following link : http://www.gasbuddy.com/gb_gastemperaturemap.aspx 
(6) Assuming the general accuracy of the data underlying the map , 
(7) differences in do not explain zone pricing . 
(8) Look at Arizona , for example . 
(9) There are much higher transportation costs in and around the Grand Canyon and much more competition in the [6424]{Phoenix} market . 
(10) Yet , [6424]{Phoenix} prices tend to be signficantly higher . 
(11) Ditto for taxes . 
(12) From what [6428]{I} quickly found on the Internet , total fuel taxes for the following four states are [6415]{VA} -LRB- 37.7 cents -RRB- ; [6420]{Utah} -LRB- 42.5 cents -RRB- ; [6423]{NC} -LRB- 45.6 cents -RRB- and [6427]{Montana} -LRB- 46.2 cents -RRB- . 
(13) However , both [6427]{Montana} and [6420]{Utah} have average prices that are significantly lower than either [6415]{VA} or [6423]{NC} . 
(14) There 's probably less relationship to costs and zone pricing than the oil companies want the public to believe . 
(15) [6428]{I} had a conversation with [6414]{a friend} the other day who owns an SUV 
(16) and [6414]{he} is n't worried about the price of [6425]{gas} because [6414]{he} travels less than 10 miles a day .. 
(17) yes .. 
(18) [6425]{it} 'll cost more ... 
(19) so [6414]{he} 'll have to cut back on [6414]{his} gourmet coffee ... two cups rather than three . :--RRB- 
(20) seriously - it 's about how far folks choose to drive and how folks define phrases like `` I must and have no choice '' . 
(21) It takes a hard knock for [6429]{folks} to take a hard look at things [6429]{they} always assumed could not change . 
(22) [6428]{I} predict ... lots of folks will be taking harder looks at whether or not choices are choices or no choice '' is truly no choice . 
(23) [6428]{I} know it happened during the gas crisis ... 
(24) and as bad as it is now - this is not as bad as then - though if $ 3 a gallon is in the rear view mirror and $ 4 a gallon on the horizon and coming fast ... we might think so ... 
(25) .. but [6428]{I} would bet that folks would choose -LRB- there 's that word again -RRB- $ 4 or even $ 5 a gallon rather than waiting in line for 3 hours only to find out the guy in front of you got the last tankful . 
(26) America 's love affair with the automobile is about to be revisted though [6428]{I} doubt seriously a divorce is anywhere near ... :--RRB- 
(27) sorry .. [6428]{my} attitude is grin and bear it ... 
(28) it 's sort of like coffee doubling in price ... 
(29) [6428]{my} property accessment going up 300 % -LRB- which [6426]{it} did -RRB- ... 
(30) ... and today .. [6428]{I} paid $ 68 bucks to fill up my 89 Ford Van . 
(31) [6428]{I} got ta talk to [6416]{Ray Hyde} about [6419]{that Hybrid .... he 's got} .. 
(32) [6416]{he} said if [6416]{he} had to choose .. [6416]{he} 'd keep [6416]{his} truck ... :--RRB- 
(33) Did [6416]{I} really say that ? 
(34) That would be a tough `` choice '' . 
(35) With [6421]{the truck} [6416]{I} 'd have some chance of making money , 
(36) but [6416]{I} 'd hate to have to drive [6421]{it} if [6421]{it} was n't working . 
(37) If you have to drive , [6419]{the hybrid} is a joy . 
(38) Dead silent , dirt cheap , reliable , little bit of capital cost detriment , sufficient power . 
(39) 48 mpg if you drive at 75+ like a maniac . 
(40) [6416]{I} remember [6417]{people} sniffing at [6419]{it} , saying [6417]{they} would n't do it because the payback on capital was n't there . 
(41) [6416]{I} drone on about [6418]{costs and benefits} , but a -RRB- [6418]{that} 's not everything , and b -RRB- sometimes circumstances change . 
(42) [6416]{I} 'm going to have to send a letter to the guv'nor . 
(43) [6416]{I} have a bunch of vehicles and only use the appropriate one for the task at hand . 
(44) [6416]{I} need a portable license plate and insurance , otherwise the current `` tax '' plan is going to kill [6416]{me} . 
(45) [6416]{I} sure hope that those of you who think saving open space and farms will chip in and help out on this : 
(46) send a letter . 
(47) [6416]{I} do n't mind paying what it costs to drive or paying what [6416]{I} owe , 
(48) but this is going to be whacked . 
(49) [6416]{I} suspect that overhead costs might have something to do with fuel prices . 
(50) That gas station in Fairfax is sitting on expensive land and paying high taxes . 
(51) Businesses are `` tax positive '' do n't cha know . 
(52) If people really do start making different choices , it 's going to be fun to watch real estate prices . 
(53) BTW 13 % more new home sales last year , in spite of higher rates , 
(54) but prices were down 5k . 
(55) Time to demand another reassessment . 
(56) [6416]{Ray Hyde} : Taxes are indeed business overhead that affect retail prices . 
(57) But [6416]{I} still suggest that zone pricing has more to do with computer software and data - mining than actual costs .

(0) Fixing traffic problems ? 
(1) Hardly . 
(2) Likewise , if [6448]{we} are in a transportation mess , why are n't [6448]{our} elected officials -- especially the Senate -- addressing VDOT 's total lack of internal cost controls ? 
(3) Walk the talk . 
(4) OK . 
(5) Now we agree . 
(6) [6447]{Lobbying groups} should be free to lobby . 
(7) But [6447]{they} had better bring an argument that is supportable as in `` prioritize transportation projects based on what expenditures would produce the most improvement in traffic flow '' and not as in `` its was the taxpayers ' job to pay for the infrastructure to support whatever he built '' , and not as in `` new roads will do nothing for 99 % of the drivers '' . 
(8) And officials should be free to say no when it does n't make any sense . 
(9) That goes for lobbyists on both sides of the fence . 
(10) Now , if we can just find some agreement on what does make sense .... 
(11) [6445]{I} agree that [6446]{Metro} to Dulles wo n't do a thing for traffic congestion , 
(12) but [6445]{I} 'm not so sure [6449]{it} does n't make some sense by some other measure . 
(13) But clearly , using tolls to pay for [6446]{Metro} -LRB- instead of road improvements -RRB- while simultaneously claiming that [6450]{cars and roads} do n't pay [6450]{their} way is both nutso and egregiously unfair . 
(14) Those that benefit should pay , but at the same time , we ca n't make egregious statements about who benefits , or who does n't . 
(15) At some level , everybody benefits , but the benefits probably decrease rapidly with distance . 
(16) Whatever formula we come up with is going to be complex , 
(17) but we ought to be able to come up with [6451]{something that is a -RRB- measurable and b -RRB- makes enough sense so that all but the nut cases can see the sense in it} .

(0) [6460]{I} favor higher gas taxes and user fees , too , but not exclusively because we all have a stake in roads . 
(1) [6460]{I} would make the same argument for transit : 
(2) it is OK for the general public or auto drivers -LRB- which is much the same thing -RRB- to provide some support for transit because there is [6462]{some -LRB- small -RRB- benefit to everyone for those that are able and willing to use Metro etc.} 
(3) On the other hand , once we understand how small [6462]{that benefit} really is we might decide [6462]{it} 's just not worth it , 
(4) and we should let [6461]{the thing} be privatized where [6461]{it} works and disappear where [6461]{it} does n't . 
(5) [6460]{I} 'm with you . 
(6) We can not take hard lines on every issue and make progress in any direction . 
(7) Unfortunately , for some , [6463]{strategic stalemate} is just as good as any other means of conservation , never mind whatever other harm [6463]{it} does .

(0) [6509]{Toll roads} are 4 times more costly to run , than by using the gas tax . 
(1) And in fact in [6514]{Virginia} it will cost even more as there is no big bureaucracy in place to administer [6509]{it} . 
(2) Got to staff all those toll booths . 
(3) Health insurance , retirement funds , sick leave , uniforms , and a huge HR department to make sure all those federal regulations are followed it but the opening salvo . 
(4) Let 's not forget the `` maintenance '' costs . 
(5) Toll booths , collection machines -LRB- electronic devices for you `` EZ Pass '' sheep are 10 times more costly to maintain -RRB- 
(6) And then there is the risk . 
(7) The risk being experienced by [6510]{the Dulles Toll Road folks who have been losing more money than they knew they could lose} . 
(8) People will avoid [6513]{your road} if [6513]{it} 's toll ! 
(9) The people who keep harping about `` [6517]{tolls} '' typically have no knowlege of how expensive it is to both run [6517]{it} and maintain [6517]{it} . 
(10) The sensible , logical way to fund roads is with a bureaucracy that is already established . 
(11) Gas Tax . 
(12) However , this all ignores the need for a complete housecleaning at [6508]{VDOT} . 
(13) The root cause of why people do n't want to give more money to [6514]{the state} for roads . 
(14) One glaring example . 
(15) The bogus , made up `` On time - On budget '' figures that [6508]{VDOT} has been parading about . 
(16) Were you aware that [6508]{VDOT} does not include projects that are n't `` on time '' or `` over budget '' in that figure ? 
(17) The i / Mercury Blvd project that is 77 % over budget and almost 3 - years behind schedule -LRB- by [6508]{VDOT 's} own account -RRB- IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE `` On time - On budget '' figure . 
(18) Fix [6508]{VDOT} first , then come back and talk about how you are going to fund our so called `` transportation crisis '' . 
(19) The only crisis in transportation we have in [6514]{Virginia} is a loss of trust and confidence in both [6508]{VDOT} and the Legislature . 
(20) I 'm with Pat . 
(21) [6512]{Tolls} are a lousy idea . 
(22) [6512]{They} are a cheap shot way for [6511]{the legislators} to push [6511]{their} fialurs off on the faceless foreign businesses , and [6512]{they} are supported by [6516]{people who think the tolls wo n't affect them} . 
(23) If this catches on , we will live to regret the day . 
(24) We have tried [6515]{private tolls} before , and [6515]{they} did n't work . 
(25) As for trains , forget it unless your goods are travelling 600 miles or so , and happen to be gong in the same direction as the tracks . 
(26) [6518]{The reasosn} has less to do with the subsidies enjoyed by highways and truckers than [6518]{it} has to do with speed , reliability , and convenience .

(0) -LRB- At least that is a widely held belief . -RRB- 
(1) b -RRB- the additional costs -LRB- for proffers and such -RRB- over and above ordinary and sufficient property taxes were carefully examined to cover only the new and extraordinary capital costs associated solely with new residents . 
(2) That means that you can not blame the new residents for increased capital costs that are really in support of new desires or needs on the part of all residents . 
(3) Say crime is up 50 % so you need [6555]{a new jail} . 
(4) At the same time new residents are planned to be up 25 % . 
(5) How much of the cost of [6555]{the new jail} should [6567]{the new residents} pay ? 
(6) Are you going to hold [6567]{them} responsible for the 50 % of increased need that is due to existing residents ? 
(7) [6565]{I} understand [6562]{Larry} 's point , 
(8) but [6565]{I} think it is intellectually too easy to be correct . 
(9) [6565]{I} particularly like this : [6556]{Another way of looking at this is that if new folks had to pay their actual share of infrastructure costs - there would be less money for bigger homes and new SUV and long solo commutes} . 
(10) [6556]{That} is absolutely correct , 
(11) and [6556]{it} corresponds to EMR 's gloomy prediction that we will all face lowered expectations . 
(12) But what if the choice is a smaller home in the exurbs and a hybrid ? 
(13) [6556]{It} is a fine argument , 
(14) but [6565]{I} do n't think we know anywhere near enough to actually and fairly assess the costs of new infrastructure , on the one hand . 
(15) On the other hand , if [6566]{the newcomers} pay for [6566]{their} own infrastructure , especially if we *require* [6566]{them} to pay for [6566]{their} own infrastructure , then we should not be too surprised if [6566]{they} claim to own [6568]{it} and wish to exclude us . 
(16) This has already happened with [6569]{some gated communities} . 
(17) [6569]{They} provided [6560]{things like bike paths} , and now the outside community wants connectivity to [6560]{those assets} without picking up part of the costs . 
(18) It is the same with riparian setbacks and other increased demands on private income or property . 
(19) [6565]{I} do n't see how we can expect it to be shared infrastructure that we all benefit from unless we [6563]{share} some of the costs . 
(20) At present , we ca n't even agree on what `` some of '' amounts to , let alone if [6563]{it} is a fair distribution . 
(21) What if the choice is between a larger home and an SUV in the exurbs or a smaller home and maybe no car in the inner areas , AND AT A HIGHER PRICE , including travel ? 
(22) [6559]{Policy Soup} hsa a comment on the same subject that says , `` [6559]{I} lived in [6571]{Crystal City} for many years after college . 
(23) The Underground was , and remains , the greatest feature . 
(24) The only drawback to [6571]{Crystal City} was no yards . 
(25) The location was great , but [6571]{the place} was too urban for anyone with a family . 
(26) The higher density development that has been going on there for the past five years or so is a crime - 
(27) you ca n't even cross the street on foot , everything is so congested ! 
(28) So much for the `` pedestrian friendly '' model - 
(29) Arlington seems determined to kill pedestrians , forcing people who used to walk to drive two blocks like in Clarnedon due to overcrowding . 
(30) Let 's pray [6557]{they} stop compounding [6557]{their} errors , lest the whole place decline . '' 
(31) It may turn out that we need more space not just to live and travel , but to make way for difference of opinion . 
(32) re : newcomers / infrastructure / longevity 
(33) Well .. [6562]{I} do n't think infrastructure `` wears out '' in the usual sense but [6562]{I} do accept the premise for some things . 
(34) [6570]{Roads and water / sewer} are not replaced . 
(35) [6570]{They} are , instead , maintained . 
(36) Schools and Prisons and other buildings can eventually wear out and need replacement . 
(37) But [6562]{I} am talking about new infrastructure that would not be needed if an area was not experiencing growth . 
(38) All communities have CIPs -LRB- capital investment plans -RRB- for infrastructure - both replacement and but replacement infrastructure IS something that can be accomodated in an annual budget - much like figuring out how many buses the school system needs to replace - every year - 
(39) it 's a known calculation . 
(40) But [6561]{new infrastructure} is not because [6561]{it} depends on the RATE of growth 
(41) and [6562]{I} think there would be strenuous disagreement with the claim that `` That means that you can not blame the new residents for increased capital costs that are really in support of new desires or needs on the part of all residents . '' 
(42) because [6558]{existing residents} are not getting `` better '' levels of services but rather expensive measures necessary to simply maintain [6558]{their} existing levels of service . 
(43) Most communities would not willinging choose nor think fair that it is the existing residents ' financial responsibility to pay for new infrastructure for new residents . 
(44) Remember , we 're not talking about a new classroom to replace the older , worn - out one . 
(45) We 're talking about a new ADDITIONAL classroom .

(0) As we 've discussed elsewhere on this blog , the transfer of wealth between regions is accounted for primarily by the `` Standards of Quality '' funding formula that redistributes resources from affluent school systems to poor school systems , and secondarily by road - funding formulas that favor rural areas . 
(1) Your criticisms should be directed to [6595]{those two particular funding formulas} , not to the `` General Assembly '' as a whole . 
(2) [6594]{Northern Virginia 's} gripes over [6595]{these funding formulas} could be shared by the affluent suburbs of the [6599]{Richmond} area -- 
(3) but you do n't hear [6599]{Richmond} suburbanites fantasizing about seceding from the state . 
(4) -LRB- For the record : [6601]{I} live in Henrico County . -RRB- 
(5) [6600]{Some Northern Virginians} want it both ways . 
(6) [6600]{They} 're entirely happy with the arrangement that divests [6594]{it} from any responsibility for the `` inner city '' of e Washington , D.C. , and all those icky poor people , 
(7) and [6600]{they} would like to divest [6594]{itself} from responsibility for outlying rural areas as well . 
(8) In other words , [6600]{these people} advocate cherry picking the most affluent suburban jurisdictions of [6594]{NoVa} , creating a separate political entity for [6600]{themselves} and insulating [6600]{themselves} from the urban and rural poor . 
(9) A gated community on a regional scale ! 
(10) [6601]{Jim} , is n't [6597]{that} what congestion pricing does , [6597]{place} a toll gate on [6598]{the community} ? 
(11) [6602]{Ray} , congestion pricing [6596]{uses} the pricing mechanism to allocate scarce roadway capacity .

(0) In the 1980s [6641]{some critics} advanced pluralism as art 's natural condition . 
(1) [6641]{They} were partly right . 
(2) The idea that two or more kinds of ultimate artistic reality could comfortably coexist has n't always been in vogue . 
(3) Twentieth century art was long charted as an almost linear succession of `` isms '' -- from Fauvism in 1905 to Abstract Expressionism in the 1950s -- discrete movements that each expressed its own unitary view of things . 
(4) The monolithic view that had congealed by the 1960s was a belief that the eye held dominion over art . 
(5) That limited judgment was toppled by Conceptualism , which devalued everything visual in art and instead polished up the stature of ideas . 
(6) `` [6636]{The idea} becomes the machine that makes the art , '' Sol LeWitt famously wrote in 1967 to explain Conceptual art . 
(7) And [6636]{the idea} could range far and wide , encompassing virtually any subject , attitude or experience one might imagine . 
(8) Looking back from today 's art world , though , [6634]{a slightly different history of eclectic art} suggests [6634]{itself} . 
(9) Conceptual art does n't mark the decisive break , just the elaboration and consolidation of an idea already in play . 
(10) Pop art [6642]{marks} the most profound rupture . 
(11) The landmark exhibition of [6640]{Robert Rauschenberg 's} 1950s hybrids of painting and sculpture that closed recently at the Museum of Contemporary Art convinced me of [6642]{that} . 
(12) [6633]{Rauschenberg , together with Jasper Johns ,} set the stage for Pop . 
(13) [6633]{Their} work undermined [6630]{art 's established structure} . 
(14) Pop art tipped [6630]{it} over . 
(15) With [6629]{its} commercial subject matter , pitch - perfect sense of style , wicked humor , easy sociability and serious refusal to take art too seriously , [6629]{Pop} made hash of [6639]{the rigid hierarchy of high art -LRB- painting , sculpture , drawing -RRB- and low art -LRB- TV , tabloids , photographs -RRB-} . 
(16) An entrenched legacy of an aristocratic worldview , [6639]{this hierarchy of high and low} was traded in for a more fluid , porous pecking order . 
(17) [6637]{The early - '60s work of Andy Warhol , Edward Ruscha and Roy Lichtenstein} is as brainy as the existential subjects of the Abstract Expressionist artists that preceded [6632]{them} , 
(18) and [6637]{it} is also as dumb as the Sunday funnies are . 
(19) That 's about as eclectic as a work of art can be . 
(20) One place the breadth and scope of the contemporary art scene is creating increasing pressures is in museums . 
(21) Few were engaged with contemporary art 30 years ago , 
(22) but many have waded in , desirous of the energy and public interest that come with the territory . 
(23) Few , however , are equipped to handle [6638]{the lively situation} since [6638]{it} contradicts the orderly traditions of institutional structure . 
(24) Nowhere has the problem been more keenly felt than in New York , center of not just the art market and art media but traditional museum culture . 
(25) Contemporary programming at the Guggenheim , the Metropolitan , the Modern and Whitney can most charitably be described as a train wreck . 
(26) So , what 's going on with contemporary art these days ? 
(27) It 's a post-Pop world , `` ism '' - free and with no end in sight . 
(28) Pop culture used to be synonymous with mass culture , 
(29) but in the era of 500 cable channels , iPods and the Internet , broadcasting has faltered and been joined by vibrant narrowcasting . 
(30) Contemporary art 's avid audience now approaches in size the ratings for HBO 's latest hit . 
(31) [6635]{America 's} political battles of the past 20 years may center on attempts to repeal or defend [6631]{the dramatic changes wrought during the 1960s} , but [6635]{our} robust artistic bounty today is [6631]{its} resplendent legacy .

(0) In 1809 , rue Tire - Boudin -LRB- '' Sausage - Puller street '' -RRB- became rue Marie - Stuart ; 
(1) rue Trousse - Nonain , or `` Tumble - Nun street '' , already disguised in official documents as Tasse - Nonian , became rue Beaubourg ; 
(2) rue de la Pute - y - muse , or `` Idling Tart street '' , became Petit - muse , while the scatological collection of rues Merdeuses , Merdelet , Chieurs and Chiards all disappeared from Haussmann 's new maps of [6669]{the rational and hygienic city} . 
(3) Nowadays , one of the last bastions of a uniquely Parisian approach to sex is [6673]{Le Beverly , the only true porno cinema in the city centre , which , over the past few years , has been regularly preparing to close its doors for the last time} . 
(4) [6673]{This cinema} stands at the top edge of the red - light district of [6672]{rue Saint - Denis} , almost but not quite in the rapidly gentrifying area of Montorgueil St - Denis . 
(5) Over the door , there is a photograph of [6671]{the poet Rimbaud} and [6671]{his} famous line `` Il faut reinventer l 'amour '' -LRB- '' Love must be reinvented '' -RRB- . 
(6) A poster in felt - tip pen offers special rates for couples on Thursday nights . 
(7) Most of the old - style porno cinemas in [6669]{Paris} were swept away in the 1980s , victims of the booming video trade and the regular appearance of hard - core porn on mainstream television . 
(8) [6673]{Le Beverly} somehow struggled through the 1990s . 
(9) Most of [6675]{the customers who now come} are visibly die - hards . 
(10) [6670]{Some of them} looked too old to be even interested in sex . 
(11) Perhaps [6670]{they} come for companionship and out of loyalty . 
(12) Others look sinister and sheepish in equal measure . 
(13) [6676]{A handful of third - world immigrants} sit back in [6676]{their} seats , smoking . 
(14) [6673]{Le Beverly} has never been respectable - the atmosphere in [6673]{the pitch - black salle de spectacle} is tense and fervid , with more than a hint of real physical danger . 
(15) But to visit [6673]{this place , in all its sleazy glory} , is to take a trip to a bygone era : a time - maybe this was the 1960s or 1970s - when showing sex in a public space was a real transgression and possibly a real thrill . 
(16) These days , as a short stroll down [6672]{rue Saint - Denis} or through the back streets of Pigalle - where porn DVDs are on sale at knock - down rates - reveals the opposite is true . 
(17) [6674]{I} left [6673]{the Beverly} intrigued but not quite convinced by Ovidie 's argument that writing or screening sex is in itself a genuinely subversive statement of wilful and unrepentant erotic intent . 
(18) This may have been the case in the 18th century , or even in the 1970s , 
(19) but , nowadays , [6674]{I} felt the vision of [6677]{the writer Michel Houellebecq - who , in one of his poems , brilliantly describes , with appalled precision , the deadly routine of the hand - jobs and peep - shows available to fit in with the office hours of the central city -} was indeed a more grimly accurate vision of [6669]{21st - century Paris} . 
(20) `` Our civilisation suffers from vital exhaustion , '' [6677]{Houellebecq} writes elsewhere , 
(21) `` We need adventure and eroticism because we need to hear ourselves repeat that life [6668]{is} marvellous and exciting ; 
(22) and it 's abundantly clear that we rather doubt [6668]{this} . '' 
(23) [6669]{Paris} is evidently no longer the capital of sex 
(24) but [6669]{it} is mutating into something else ; an international sex theme park . 
(25) As [6674]{I} walked away from Club 88 and then [6673]{Le Beverly} , it seemed to [6674]{me} that this theory explained the strangely drab and haunted faces on the whores [6674]{I} passed at the top end of [6672]{rue Saint - Denis} .

(0) As we might expect from someone so radically self - estranged , the result has been nothing less than a metamorphosis . 
(1) [6695]{Michael 's} journey of self - discovery is a work in progress like no other because [6694]{it} increasingly depends on the accommodation of two irreconcilables : the child and adult as one . 
(2) More revealing of [6699]{itself} than [6699]{its} favorite target , [6699]{public opinion} has not seen fit to grant [6695]{Michael} the inalienable right to [6695]{his} confused mental state and ' off the wall ' comportment . 
(3) If most people subscribe to the notion that black and white are not only skin colors but states of mind , why are we baffled or offended when [6695]{Michael , who was introduced to the white ways of Hollywood at the age of 5 ,} tells us that [6695]{he} is n't sure what [6695]{his} true color is ? 
(4) Robbed of [6695]{his} childhood , abused by a psychotic father and then prematurely subjected to the adult pressures of the entertainment world , why are we surprised to learn that [6695]{Michael} does n't want to grow up , that [6695]{he} prefers the company and community of children , that [6695]{he} wants to be protected and looked after ? 
(5) Every time [6695]{the androgynous Jackson} goes under the knife [6695]{he} is crying out that [6695]{he} does n't know if [6695]{he} is man or woman , child or adult , black or white . 
(6) As if we would have done otherwise in [6695]{his} situation ? 
(7) And to the never - ending suspicion that [6695]{Michael} is a child abuser , what crime has been committed when two experimenting 11 - year - olds fool around sexually ? 
(8) If you believe that [6695]{Michael} has the mentality of an 11 - year - old , -LRB- and there has n't been much evidence to the contrary during the past 20 years -RRB- [6695]{he} should not have had to defend [6695]{himself} against accusations of child molestation . 
(9) Was it in defense of perversity or [6695]{his} incorrigible innocence that convinced [6695]{him} that it was OK to reveal that [6695]{he} shared [6695]{his} bed with children ? 
(10) More questionable , even criminal , than [6695]{Michael} 's alleged fooling around with other kids , were [6696]{the parents who allowed , even encouraged their children to sleep over and perhaps share the same bed with someone whose sexual predilections have been suspect since 1991} . 
(11) On June 13 , 2005 , the courts found [6695]{Michael} not guilty of the charges brought against [6695]{him} . 
(12) However , those whose minds were decided on [6695]{his} guilt before the trial began will not be changed by the verdict , just as [6695]{Michael 's} essential nature will not have changed . 
(13) Mahatma Gandhi writes that ' There is [6697]{a higher court than courts of justice} and [6697]{that} is the court of conscience . ' 
(14) [6698]{Only Michael} knows if [6698]{he} is sexually attracted to children , and beyond that , if [6698]{he} has ever acted on those feelings . 
(15) And if we grant [6698]{him} the mental age of an 11 - year - old , who has nonetheless conventionally fathered two children , [6698]{Michael} is then a child trapped in an adult body . 
(16) Which means the crowning act in [6698]{his} quest for authenticity awaits one final operation . 
(17) What does [6700]{a man} do when [6700]{he} feels , acts and responds like a woman trapped in a man 's body ? 
(18) [6700]{He} undergoes sexual reassignment surgery and hormone therapy in order to become who ' [6700]{she} ' is . 
(19) There remains one final procedure that will totally liberate the child that [6698]{Michael} is . 
(20) When [6698]{Michael} finds the courage to act on what [6698]{his} duty toward other children demands -- submit to voluntary neutering -- which will be tantamount to [6698]{his} final confession , the saving grace and glory that is [6698]{his} Neverland will become [6698]{his} forever land . 
(21) Tennessee Williams has said for all time , `` there 's not enough kindness in the world . '' 
(22) And I say this to [6698]{you} , [6698]{Michael Jackson} , may [6698]{your} tribe increase .

(7) For fifty years , [6720]{Luis Bunuel} made films about society 's dilemmas . 
(8) [6720]{His} art is [6720]{his} declaration of confidence in a human race dominated by [6718]{a bourgeoisie given to hypocrisy , sadism , and above all , a disrespect for its own capacity to live differently and better} . 
(9) [6720]{He} summed it all up [6720]{himself} : 
(10) As [6720]{I} drift toward [6720]{my} last sigh , [6720]{I} often imagine a final joke . 
(11) [6720]{I} convoke around [6720]{my} deathbed [6720]{my} friends who are confirmed atheists as [6720]{I} am .

(0) How to Help 
(1) [6736]{Very few organizations} are working on getting aid to Iraqi refugees , and of [6736]{those that are} , many are too small or too beleaguered to accept individual donations ; 
(2) [6738]{the Iraqi Red Crescent} , for example , has suffered bombings and mass kidnappings , yet [6738]{its} volunteers continue to deliver aid to displaced families inside Iraq . 
(3) One of the larger relief organizations working with the refugees is [6737]{the Catholic group Caritas , whose caseworkers I shadowed while in Amman} . 
(4) Bucking the image of the Land Rover - driving aid worker , [6740]{they} made [6740]{their} rounds in [6735]{an aging gray Honda , its roof eaten through by rust} . 
(5) [6740]{They} visited Iraqi doctors , engineers , and executives desperate for food , heat , or blankets to fend off the desert winter ; 
(6) [6739]{one family} told [6740]{the crew} [6739]{they} had just sold [6739]{their} stove to buy food . 
(7) [6737]{Caritas} helps a few thousand families a year , 
(8) but the demand far outstrips the money available to [6737]{us} , says Magy Mahrous , who oversees the project .

(1) and [6794]{I} knew that if [6794]{I} did n't pay up [6799]{they} would burn [6800]{the car} . 
(2) Above all , [6794]{I} did n't want another beating . 
(3) [6794]{I} had been whipped , [6794]{my} shirt was in tatters 
(4) and [6794]{I} reeked of benzene . 
(5) There was only one way out : to [6798]{run} [6797]{the roadblock} . 
(6) [6798]{It} was risky because [6794]{I} might wreck [6800]{the car} or [6800]{it} might catch fire . 
(7) But [6794]{I} had no choice . 
(8) [6794]{I} floored it . 
(9) [6797]{The roadblock} was a kilometre ahead . 
(10) The speedometer needle jumped : 110 , 120 , 140 . 
(11) [6800]{The car} shimmied 
(12) and [6794]{I} gripped the wheel more tightly . 
(13) [6794]{I} leaned on the horn . 
(14) When [6794]{I} was right on top of [6797]{it} [6794]{I} could see that [6796]{the bonfire} stretched all the way across the road . 
(15) [6799]{The activists} were waving [6799]{their} knives for [6794]{me} to stop . 
(16) [6794]{I} saw that two of [6799]{them} were winding up to throw [6795]{bottles of gasoline} at [6800]{the car} 
(17) and for a second [6794]{I} thought , so , this is the end , 
(18) this is the end , 
(19) but there was no turning back . 
(20) There was no turning ... 
(21) [6794]{I} smashed into [6796]{the fire} , 
(22) [6800]{the car} jumped , 
(23) there was a hammering against the belly pan , 
(24) sparks showered over the windshield . 
(25) And suddenly - [6797]{the roadblock} , the fire and the shouting were behind [6794]{me} . 
(26) [6795]{The bottles} had missed . 
(27) Hounded by terror [6794]{I} drove another kilometre 
(28) and then [6794]{I} stopped to make sure [6800]{the car} was n't on fire . 
(29) [6800]{It} was n't on fire . 
(30) [6794]{I} was all wet . 
(31) All [6794]{my} strength had left [6794]{me} ; 
(32) [6794]{I} was incapable of fighting ; 
(33) [6794]{I} was wide open , defenceless . 
(34) [6794]{I} sat down on the sand and felt sick to [6794]{my} stomach . 
(35) Everything around [6794]{me} was alien . 
(36) An alien sky and alien trees . Alien hills and manioc fields .
